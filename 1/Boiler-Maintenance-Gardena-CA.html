Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
