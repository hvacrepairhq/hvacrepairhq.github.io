<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
