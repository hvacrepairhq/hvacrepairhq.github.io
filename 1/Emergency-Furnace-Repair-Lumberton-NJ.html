<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
