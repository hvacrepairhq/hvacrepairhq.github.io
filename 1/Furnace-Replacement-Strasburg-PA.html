<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Strasburg PA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
