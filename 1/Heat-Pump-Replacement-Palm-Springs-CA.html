<p>Picking the ideal size a/c is an important part of the HVAC buying procedure and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to assist you with. Here's why purchasing the right size air conditioner matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too big, you'll wind up squandering money and energy. And if it's too little, you won't get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
