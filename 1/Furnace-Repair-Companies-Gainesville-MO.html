<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Over the previous few years, there has actually been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have been shown to decrease levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is presently no evidence, however, that an affordable variety of houseplants eliminate substantial amounts of contaminants in offices and houses. Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered because extremely wet soil may promote the development of bacteria which can affect allergic individuals.<p>
