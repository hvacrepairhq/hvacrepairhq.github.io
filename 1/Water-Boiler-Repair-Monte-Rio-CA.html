<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins which abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Monte Rio CA?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
