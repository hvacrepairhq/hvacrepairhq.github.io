Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
