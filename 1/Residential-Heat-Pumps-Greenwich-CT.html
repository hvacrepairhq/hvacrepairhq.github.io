By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be done in just a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem.
