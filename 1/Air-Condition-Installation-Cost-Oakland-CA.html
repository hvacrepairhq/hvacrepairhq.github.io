<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>To identify the right size of oil furnace you need for your home, determine the house's square video footage and determine what zone your home remains in. Speak With the U.S. Energy Details Administration's environment zone map to determine your zone number. Increase the length and width of each room in your home that you heat and build up all the rooms together to get your overall square video footage.<p>
<p>Most well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water generally picks up lead inside the house from home plumbing that is made with lead materials. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked, the only method to know. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water evaluated. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may become stopped up, decreasing air circulation circulation, quality, and volume. They also might become locations for molds and bacteria to grow and be dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise must be properly preserved to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
