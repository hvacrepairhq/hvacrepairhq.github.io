<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has actually been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have actually been shown to lower levels of some chemicals in lab experiments.

Indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered since excessively moist soil may promote the growth of microbes which can impact allergic people.<p>
