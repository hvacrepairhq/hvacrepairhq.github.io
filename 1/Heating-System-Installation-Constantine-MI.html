<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, considering that it is secured inside. When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a better solution. If the present system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and treated, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
