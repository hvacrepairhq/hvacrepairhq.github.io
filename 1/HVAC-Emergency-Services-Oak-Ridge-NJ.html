<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Oak Ridge NJ</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
