<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in collecting details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
