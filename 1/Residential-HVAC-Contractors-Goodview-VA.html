<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Goodview VA</h3>
<p>A split a/c system may cost near to that of a standard HVAC system but has actually shown to be an alternative cost effective alternative to houses that do not have ductwork. Utilized in addition to other kinds of heating or cooling, such as portable or window air conditioners, area heating units, or oil heating units, it can enhance the comfort of your home while keeping your regular monthly energy costs sensible.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
