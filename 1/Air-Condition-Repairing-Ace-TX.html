<p>Specialist heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC experts suggest following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Ace TX</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
