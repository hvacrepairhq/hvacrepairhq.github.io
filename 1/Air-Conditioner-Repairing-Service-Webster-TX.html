<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a solution. An experienced technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant.

Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
