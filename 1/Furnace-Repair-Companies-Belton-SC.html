<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Belton SC</h3>
<p>Most people don't know how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the damp hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC unit is not draining properly. A restriction in your drainage pipes causes a water leakage. There are various places an obstruction can happen. Among the main areas where obstructions start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
