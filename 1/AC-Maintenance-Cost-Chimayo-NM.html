<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow restriction will reduce the system's efficiency.

For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
