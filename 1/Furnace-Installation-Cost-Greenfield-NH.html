<p>All houses need efficient ventilation.

In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger instant symptoms but can lead to cancer after several years.<p>
<p>For instance, impurities might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment. Or if the outside air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outdoor contaminant, it may function as a pathway to carry the impurities inside.

<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Greenfield New Hampshire</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
