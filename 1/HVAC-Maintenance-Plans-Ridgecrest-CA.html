<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to utilizing a radiant heating system over a conventional forced air heating system.
