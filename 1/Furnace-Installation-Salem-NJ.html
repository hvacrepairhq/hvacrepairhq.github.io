In a consisted of system like a home, the warmer things naturally heat the cooler ones until a balance is achieved.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the unit has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
