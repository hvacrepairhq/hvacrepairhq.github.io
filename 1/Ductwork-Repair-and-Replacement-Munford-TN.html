Not just was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>The icing problem ends up being much more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heatpump are typically installed in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
