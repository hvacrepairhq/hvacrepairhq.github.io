<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
