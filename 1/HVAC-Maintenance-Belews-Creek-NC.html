<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
