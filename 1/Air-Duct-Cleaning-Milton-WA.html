<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the home. Pollutants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and bacteria, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
