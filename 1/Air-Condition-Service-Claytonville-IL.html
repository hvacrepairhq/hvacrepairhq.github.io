Structures constantly evolve as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them along with the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The numerous surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously connecting, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For example, we might see a window as changing somewhat over time as it ends up being unclean, then is cleaned up, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life.
