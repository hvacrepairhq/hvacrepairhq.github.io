The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

As a result, the most efficient way to minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to remove smoking there.<p>
