<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Replacing your old furnace with a new, more effective model can combat unstable energy prices, minimizing your heating expenses by approximately 45%. Advancements in heating technology have actually resulted in systems that contaminate less, enhance comfort, and last longer. A twenty to thirty year old furnace generally has an AFUE of about 65%. The lowest performance enabled by law for new gas designs is 78%, and there are many options that achieve 98%, for near total efficiency.<p>
