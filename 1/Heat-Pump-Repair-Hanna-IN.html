<p>Some health effects can be helpful indications of an indoor air quality problem, especially if they appear after a person transfers to a new home, remodels or refurnishes a home, or treats a house with pesticides. If you think that you have signs that might be connected to your house environment, discuss them with your medical professional or your local health department to see if they might be caused by indoor air contamination.

<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely define the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that need to be continuously provided in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be useful in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
