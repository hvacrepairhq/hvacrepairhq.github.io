<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
