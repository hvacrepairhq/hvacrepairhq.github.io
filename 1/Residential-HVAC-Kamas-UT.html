<p>The properties and structure of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them up until they have actually been properly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
