<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
