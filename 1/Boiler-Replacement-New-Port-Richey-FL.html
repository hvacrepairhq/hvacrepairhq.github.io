<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known fact that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will frequently build up in ductwork, limiting air flow. Since ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear very difficult at first, needing specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything needs to be replaced ultimately. As equipment ages, it ends up being less efficient. Central air systems and heatpump generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement may be the most cost-effective option.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
