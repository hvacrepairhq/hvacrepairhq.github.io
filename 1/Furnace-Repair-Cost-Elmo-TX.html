<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with concerns. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
