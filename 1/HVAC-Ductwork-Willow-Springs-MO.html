<h3>Ways To Get the Most From Your HVAC System in Willow Springs MO</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in home construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floors. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

Contractors and homeowners engaged in repair or redesigning activities should follow the EPA guide for appropriate lead management during repair and renovation activities that may result in disturbance to paint and other materials containing lead.<p>
