<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
