A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
