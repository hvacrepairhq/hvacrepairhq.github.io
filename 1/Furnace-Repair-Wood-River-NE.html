<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
