<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home.

The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
