<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
