<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
