<p>The world's leading all-in-one software for commercial and residential HVAC organisations. HVAC service technicians undergo a variety of possibly dangerous conditions.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
