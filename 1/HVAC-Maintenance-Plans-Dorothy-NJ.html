<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
