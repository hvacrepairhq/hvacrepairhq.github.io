<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
