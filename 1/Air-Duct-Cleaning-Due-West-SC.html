<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors.

Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
