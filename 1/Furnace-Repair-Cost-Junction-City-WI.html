<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road.

<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices maker's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one action specified the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated usage of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  an extremely advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
