Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.
