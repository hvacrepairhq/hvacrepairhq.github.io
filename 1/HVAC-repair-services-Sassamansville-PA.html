<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Recently, Target informed reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial invasion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a 3rd party vendor. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in concern was a heating, air and refrigeration  conditioning subcontractor that has operated at a number of locations at Target and other leading retailers.<p>
<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big seller who asked not to be named since he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps track of energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to minimize costs (especially at night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the shops vary beyond an appropriate range that might avoid clients from shopping at the store.<p>
