My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
