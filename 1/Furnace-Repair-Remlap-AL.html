<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service many years earlier and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.
