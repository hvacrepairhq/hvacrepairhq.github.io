<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
