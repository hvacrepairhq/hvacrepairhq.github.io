<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Radiant heat uses a variety of unique advantages over forced air heater. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They don't have to worry about duct leakages, which are accountable for output losses of approximately 30% in other heater types.

A house heated up by a glowing system will heat up faster, and remain warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the numerous advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>
