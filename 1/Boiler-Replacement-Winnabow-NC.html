<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture inside your home is related to a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
<p>A specific air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air path. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, given that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
