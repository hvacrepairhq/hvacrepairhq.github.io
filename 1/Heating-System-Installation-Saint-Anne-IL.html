<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
