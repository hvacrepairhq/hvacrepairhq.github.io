<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps guys working. When a sales male comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
