<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Winchester VA</h3>
<p>Whether it's the middle of winter season or summer, having a working HVAC system is essential. At Lowe's, we have a variety of heating and cooling systems-- from heating systems and heat pumps to window a/c and portable ac system Plus, we provide a/c installation and heating installation by licensed professional independent installers.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
