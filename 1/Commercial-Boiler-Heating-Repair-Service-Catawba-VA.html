<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Catawba VA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on rare occasions.<p>

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
