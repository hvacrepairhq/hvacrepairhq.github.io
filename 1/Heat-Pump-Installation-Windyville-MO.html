<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often may be due to a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
