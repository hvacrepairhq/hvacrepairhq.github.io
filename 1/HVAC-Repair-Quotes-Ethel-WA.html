<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Ethel WA?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
