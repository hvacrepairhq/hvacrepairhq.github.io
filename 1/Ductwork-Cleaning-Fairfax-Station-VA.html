<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
