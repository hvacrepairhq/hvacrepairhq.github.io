<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.
