The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
