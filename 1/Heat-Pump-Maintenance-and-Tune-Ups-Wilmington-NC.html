<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>

In some screening, even the tile split when the system was run prior to the compound had actually cured. And mortar producers might decline warranty coverage if you do not follow their instructions.<p>
