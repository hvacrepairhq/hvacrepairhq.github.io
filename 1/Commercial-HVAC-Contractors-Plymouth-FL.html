<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
