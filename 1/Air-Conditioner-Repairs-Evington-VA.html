<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
