<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat.

The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
