<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
