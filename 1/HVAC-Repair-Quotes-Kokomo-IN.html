<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not harmful, however might become hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Germs or micro-organisms might also exist within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the entire workplace or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
