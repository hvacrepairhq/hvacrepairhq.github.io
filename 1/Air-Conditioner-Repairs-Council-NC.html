<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults considering that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
