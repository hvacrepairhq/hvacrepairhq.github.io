<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
