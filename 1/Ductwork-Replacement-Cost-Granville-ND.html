<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
