<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
