<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
