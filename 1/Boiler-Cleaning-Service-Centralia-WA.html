<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your a/c unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a solution. An experienced technician must repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and efficiency of your ac system is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can attain as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers must achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
