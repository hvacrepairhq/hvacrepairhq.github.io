<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer agreements.  The so called reliable companies rip off more people than the fly by night clothing. Since I attempted to work for them, I understand. I stop since 90% of them are criminals. They stroll in with or without an agreement and start offering you things you don't require. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as an expert to validate the so called treatments and problems. 9 out of 10, I check are entirely wrong.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your employer must inspect measurements of humidity, temperature level and air flow.

For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>

The couple of times we require them for emergencies they responded rapidly and fixed the issue.<p>
