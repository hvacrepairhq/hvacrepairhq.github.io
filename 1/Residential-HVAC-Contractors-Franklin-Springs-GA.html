<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
