<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can require to choose items that will avoid indoor air issues from happening - a couple of them are mentioned here. Initially, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, consider utilizing solid wood products. Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it ends up being wet.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heater. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which immediately shut down the heatpump if temperatures drop and reach below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>If your air conditioner is old, consider purchasing an energy-efficient model. Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central units are about 15% more efficient than standard models.
