<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
