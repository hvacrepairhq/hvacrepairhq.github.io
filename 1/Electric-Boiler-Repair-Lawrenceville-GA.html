<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Service in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year ago and they've been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have dealt with the one repair I required well, and are professional and always on-time. Have been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I have actually had the chance to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been great.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>

<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz.

However the possibilities are great that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
