<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still heats up to the right temperature level.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
