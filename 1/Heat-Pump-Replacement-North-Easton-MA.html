Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
