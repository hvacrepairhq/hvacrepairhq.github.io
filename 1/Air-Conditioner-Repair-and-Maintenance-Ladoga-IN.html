<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

In the process, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air.
