<h3>Home Furnace in Rural Hall NC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
