<p>Certain immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often challenging to identify if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the time and location symptoms happen.

<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers exposure to toxins throughout cooking.
