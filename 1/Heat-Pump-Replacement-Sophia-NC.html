<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews in Sophia NC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We picked getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
