<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time.

Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
