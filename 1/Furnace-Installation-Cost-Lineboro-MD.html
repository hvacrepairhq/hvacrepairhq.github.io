<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
