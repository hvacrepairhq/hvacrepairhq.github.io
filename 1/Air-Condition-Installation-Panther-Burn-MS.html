<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
