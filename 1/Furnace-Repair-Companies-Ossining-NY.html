<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
