<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Yonkers NY</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being far more extreme with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heatpump are frequently set up in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
