<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>What You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Orange NJ</h3>
<p>Most people do not understand how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining pipes properly, you'll have a water leak. A limitation in your drainage pipelines causes a water leakage. There are several places a clog can take place. One of the main locations where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
