<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
