<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may become clogged up, reducing air flow volume, quality, and circulation.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise need to be effectively kept to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>

Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the three strategies listed below may be proper.<p>
