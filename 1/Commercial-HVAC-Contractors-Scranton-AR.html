Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
