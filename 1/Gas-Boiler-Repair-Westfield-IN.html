<p>The heatpump acquired appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from numerous sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground.

<p>Furthermore, property owners have a variety of options to pick from in powering a flooring heater. Radiant systems are compatible with electrical, gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources.
