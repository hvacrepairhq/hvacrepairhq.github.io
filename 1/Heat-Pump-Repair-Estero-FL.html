<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it may simply need to be cleaned. Whether this is the reason for the issue, it's an excellent early solution to attempt. Plan to do this on a relatively warm day. Never ever utilize a power washer for this-- it can harm the fins. The following are standards; constantly refer to your owner's manual.
