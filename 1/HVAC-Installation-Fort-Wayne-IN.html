Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
