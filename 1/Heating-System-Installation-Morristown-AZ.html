<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
