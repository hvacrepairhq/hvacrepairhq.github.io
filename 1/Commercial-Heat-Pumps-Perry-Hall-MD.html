<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
