We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have actually been finished, the last task is to evaluate the system to make certain it cools effectively. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat.
