<p>Among the main factors a furnace will run constantly is due to the fact that something is clogged or dirty Prior to trying to fix any issue, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan".

Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
