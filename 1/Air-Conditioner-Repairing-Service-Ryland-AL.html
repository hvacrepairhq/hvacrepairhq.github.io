Numerous common building products utilized before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread out into the air during the elimination process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is often advised instead.<p>

Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
