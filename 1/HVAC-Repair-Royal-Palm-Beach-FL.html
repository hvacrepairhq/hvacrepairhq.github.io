<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.
