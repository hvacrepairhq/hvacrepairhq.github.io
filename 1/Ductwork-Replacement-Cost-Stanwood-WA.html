<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
