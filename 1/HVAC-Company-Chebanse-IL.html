<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one ecological danger to the health of kids in the United States."

<p>My eldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
