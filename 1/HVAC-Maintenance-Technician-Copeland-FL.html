<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
