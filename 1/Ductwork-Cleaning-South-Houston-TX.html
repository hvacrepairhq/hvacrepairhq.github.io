<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is frequently essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can often be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this data may identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are really low, monitoring data might not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
