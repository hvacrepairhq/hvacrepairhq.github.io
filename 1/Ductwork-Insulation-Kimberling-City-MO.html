<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
