<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, including infected soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Outdoor pollutants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.

<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall.

I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
