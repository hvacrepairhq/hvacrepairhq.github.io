<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
