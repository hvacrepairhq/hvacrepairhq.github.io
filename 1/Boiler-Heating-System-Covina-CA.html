<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
