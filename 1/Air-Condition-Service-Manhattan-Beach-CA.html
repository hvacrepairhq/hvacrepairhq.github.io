<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood items used adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items produced indoor usage consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
