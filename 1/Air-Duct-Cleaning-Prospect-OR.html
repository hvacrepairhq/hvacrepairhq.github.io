<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
