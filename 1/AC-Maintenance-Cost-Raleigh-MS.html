<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
