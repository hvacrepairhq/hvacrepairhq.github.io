Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling impact. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
