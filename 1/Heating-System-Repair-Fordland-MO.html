<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Fordland Missouri</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>
