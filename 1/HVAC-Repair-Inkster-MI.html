<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>

A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER ranking in energy efficiency would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to install.

<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is usually higher than lots of heatpump choices, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the design you purchase. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating alternatives. This means it can heat up your house to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might pick to change the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit.
