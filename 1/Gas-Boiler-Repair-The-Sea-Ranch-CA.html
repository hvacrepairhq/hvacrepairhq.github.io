<p>The function of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at reasonable energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Manual J computation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for a/c. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video alone, move to another contractor.

<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my services, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes.
