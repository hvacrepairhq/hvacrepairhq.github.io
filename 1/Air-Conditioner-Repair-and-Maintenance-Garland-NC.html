<p>Considering that the 1980s, makers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient. This was initially driven by rising energy costs, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns. In addition, improvements to the HVAC system effectiveness can also help increase resident health and performance. 21 In the United States, the EPA has imposed tighter restrictions over the years. There are a number of approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, triggering your new under tile flooring heater prematurely, before the mortar has treated, can cause the grout to split or to not adhere properly, and might void the service warranty of your mortar product. In some screening, even the tile broken when the system was run prior to the compound had actually cured. If you do not follow their guidelines, and mortar producers might refuse warranty protection.<p>
