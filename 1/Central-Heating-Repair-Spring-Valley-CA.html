<p>Improve your services, earn more services earnings, and supply a remarkable customer experience. To make sure the unit you pick is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation price quote to figure out the specific type of heat and a/c system that's just right for your home-we don't just replace it with the same size unit you currently have. These estimations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the system isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because an unit is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
