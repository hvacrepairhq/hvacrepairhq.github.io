<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path.

Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
