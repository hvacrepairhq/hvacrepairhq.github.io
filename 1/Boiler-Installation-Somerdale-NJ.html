<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to industrial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>
<p>For instance, problems occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate adequate quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or put in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Incorrectly situated outside air consumption vents can likewise bring in air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
