<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in Manvel TX?</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor toxins produced by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high indoors may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor free gas that hinders the shipment of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a series of signs from headaches, d izziness, weakness, disorientation, queasiness, and confusion, to tiredness in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with persistent cardiovascular disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are often puzzled with the influenza or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, infants, elderly people, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing disease can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide direct exposures.<p>
