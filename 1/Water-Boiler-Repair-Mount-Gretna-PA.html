<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
