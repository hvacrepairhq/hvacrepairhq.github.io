<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a vicious, harsh summertime.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may select to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. Nevertheless, considering recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it might be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>
