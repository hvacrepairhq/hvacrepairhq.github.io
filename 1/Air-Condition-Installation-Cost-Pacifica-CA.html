<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same.

Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and harden-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
