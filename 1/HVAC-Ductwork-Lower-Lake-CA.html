When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping maker to circulate warm water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the flooring heat transferred heat to other posts in the spaces, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
