<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
