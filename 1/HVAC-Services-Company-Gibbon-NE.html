<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>For contaminants other than radon, measurements are most suitable when there are either health symptoms or signs of bad ventilation and specific sources or pollutants have been determined as possible reasons for indoor air quality issues.
