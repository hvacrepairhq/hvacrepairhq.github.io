<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Hillsdale KS</h3>
<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians believed they just didn't seem best and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
