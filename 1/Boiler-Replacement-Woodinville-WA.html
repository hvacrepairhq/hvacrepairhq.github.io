<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than industrial or outside settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period. Generally, SEER supplies more information based on how the EER carries out in various temps. The higher the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
