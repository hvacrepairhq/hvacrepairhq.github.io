<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece below.
