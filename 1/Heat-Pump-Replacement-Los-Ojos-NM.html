<p>My oldest son constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey found.

And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
