Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Since pesticides can be found far from the site of their initial application, it is sensible to reduce making use of chemical pesticides outdoors in addition to indoors. Depending on the site and bug to be controlled, several of the following actions can be effective: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and frequent cleaning of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be reduced or prevented by ensuring that wood structure products do not enter direct contact with the soil and by storing firewood away from the house. By properly fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be drastically decreased.<p>
