<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, given that it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
