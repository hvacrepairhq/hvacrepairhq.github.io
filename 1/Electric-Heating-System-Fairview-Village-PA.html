Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end objective.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
