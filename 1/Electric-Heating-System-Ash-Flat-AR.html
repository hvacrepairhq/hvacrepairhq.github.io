<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to purchase it. My other half stated that she had seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have actually satisfied in a very long time. We need to support the real individuals who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating.
