<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems.

Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
