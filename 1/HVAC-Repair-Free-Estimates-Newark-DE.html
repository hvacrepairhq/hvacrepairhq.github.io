But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden appear greater than normal, it is probably time to think about a brand-new system. New heating equipment is far more effective-- you'll see lower fuel costs immediately, not to mention the money you'll save money on repair costs.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
