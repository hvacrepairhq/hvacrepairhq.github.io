<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees each year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and normally some other benefits. Some companies offer concern appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>

<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the floor or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
