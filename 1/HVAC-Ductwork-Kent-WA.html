<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the increase it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the possibilities are great that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to increase and stream out high building openings to the outside (stack impact ), triggering cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation plans can utilize really little energy, however care needs to be required to ensure comfort. In damp or warm environments, maintaining thermal comfort exclusively via natural ventilation may not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>
