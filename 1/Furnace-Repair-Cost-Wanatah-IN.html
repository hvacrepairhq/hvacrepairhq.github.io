<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
