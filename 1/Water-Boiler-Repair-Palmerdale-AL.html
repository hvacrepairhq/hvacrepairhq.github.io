<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
