<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs.

Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
