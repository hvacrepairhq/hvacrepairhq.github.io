<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them till they have been correctly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Many AC systems include a variety of unique functions that can further improve performance and effectiveness. For example, homeowners might wish to try to find one that comes with a built-in filter light that will notify you when the air filter requires to be changed. Another popular function to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to reduce energy costs even more. Naturally, more functions indicate higher central air expenses.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
