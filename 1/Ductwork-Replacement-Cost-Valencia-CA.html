Structures constantly evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them in addition to the residents, products, and activities within them. The numerous surfaces and the air inside a structure are constantly interacting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For instance, we may see a window as changing somewhat in time as it ends up being filthy, then is cleaned, collects dirt once again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see may be progressing as a result of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning system and fridges utilized flammable or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
