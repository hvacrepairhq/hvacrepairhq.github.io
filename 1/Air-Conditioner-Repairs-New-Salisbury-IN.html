An air pollutant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care products.
