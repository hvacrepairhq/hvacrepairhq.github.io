<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating system can likewise be linked to a gadget referred to as a geothermal desuperheater.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
