<p>It's not suggested for uncertified individuals to inspect & repair cooling & HVAC devices. There is a threat of electric shock & death if not correctly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. If you left it to a trained ac repair Houston Midtown tech for correct HVAC diagnosis, it would be best. Constantly ensure when inspecting your air conditioning equipment to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch.
