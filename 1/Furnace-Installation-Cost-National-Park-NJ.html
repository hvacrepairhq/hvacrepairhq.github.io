<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>5. Smell good naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney scent with a clean cooking area or clean artificial fragrances in laundry items and air fresheners give off lots of various chemicals into the air.

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
