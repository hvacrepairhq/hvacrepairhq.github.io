<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic.

In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
