<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
