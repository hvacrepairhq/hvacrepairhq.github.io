<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile organic substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and common. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., office devices; floor, wall and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
