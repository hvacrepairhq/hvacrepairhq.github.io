<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978.

Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
