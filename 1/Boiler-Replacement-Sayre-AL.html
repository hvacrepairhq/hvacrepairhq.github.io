<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the maker's directions.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
