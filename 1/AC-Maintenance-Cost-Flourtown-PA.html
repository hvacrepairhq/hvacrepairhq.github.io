<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to buy it. My other half said that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have actually met in a long period of time. We require to support the real people who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
