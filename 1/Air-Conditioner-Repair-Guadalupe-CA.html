<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
