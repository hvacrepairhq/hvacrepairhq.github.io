And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
