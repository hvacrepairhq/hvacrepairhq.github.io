<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
