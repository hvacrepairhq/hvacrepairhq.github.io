<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
