<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
