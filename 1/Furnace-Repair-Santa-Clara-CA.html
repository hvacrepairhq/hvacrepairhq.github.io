<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not toxic, but might become dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate.
