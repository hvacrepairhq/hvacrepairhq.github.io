<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leaks, just including refrigerant is not a service.

Remember that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioning unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, electrical energy or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Investing on Gas Furnaces in Corydon IN</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
