<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
