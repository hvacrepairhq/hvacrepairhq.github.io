<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
