<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the maker's directions.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. Only be worried if your house is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should contact a specialist to examine and repair the system.<p>
