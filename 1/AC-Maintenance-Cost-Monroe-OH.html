<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The primary risk of mold development, as it connects to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic homes of the spore cell wall. More severe than many allergenic homes is the ability of mold to activate episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a serious respiratory disease.<p>
