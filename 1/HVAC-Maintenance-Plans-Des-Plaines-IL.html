<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Des Plaines IL?</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously getting rid of waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it increasingly challenging for your lungs to operate correctly, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
