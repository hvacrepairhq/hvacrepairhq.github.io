<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
