<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
