<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in El Sobrante CA</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality problems. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic responsibility stipulation" applies. This provision, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, states that a company should supply a healthy and safe work environment. Therefore, making certain the air is of excellent quality is the company's task.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
