<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
