<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about potential results of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's instructions, especially guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
