<p>When setting up the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one involved excavation, running numerous yards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is rather pricey. Installing a new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the examination on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health danger reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new resident I have learned how to determine the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
