<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
