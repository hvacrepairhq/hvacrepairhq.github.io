<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
