Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
