<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Niles IL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
