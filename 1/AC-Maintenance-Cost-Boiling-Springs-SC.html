<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Boiling Springs SC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by licensed HVAC technicians. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
