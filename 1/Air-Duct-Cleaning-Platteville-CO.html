<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
