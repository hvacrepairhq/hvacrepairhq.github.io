By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can usually be performed in just a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
