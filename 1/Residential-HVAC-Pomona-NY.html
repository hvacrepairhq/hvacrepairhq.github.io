Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it progressively hard for your lungs to operate properly, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been finished, the last task is to test the system to make sure it cools successfully. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This last check might explain faults in the thermostat, which might be as easy as a need to change batteries. A failure to turn on might just include a tripped circuit breaker.
