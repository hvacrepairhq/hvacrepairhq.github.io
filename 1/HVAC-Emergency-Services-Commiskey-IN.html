<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may see undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your doctor about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning, and refers to the climate control systems installed in houses or commercial homes. Their task is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the structure, to keep occupants of the structure comfortable. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of climate control system installed.<p>
