<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
