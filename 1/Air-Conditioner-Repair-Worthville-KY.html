<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the right temperature level. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
