<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by many public water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you've checked the air in your home and found a radon issue, and you have a well, contact a lab licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>The toxins listed in this guide have been revealed to trigger the health impacts discussed. Nevertheless, it is not always real that the effects kept in mind happen at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too limited to identify the levels at which the listed effects might take place.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
