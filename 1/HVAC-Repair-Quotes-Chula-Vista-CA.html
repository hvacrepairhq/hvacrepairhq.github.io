<p>Customer products which contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide in the body and can trigger symptoms associated with direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas.

Use products which contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use indoors just if the area is well ventilated.<p>
<p>Utilize experts and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated experts perform much better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might see undesirable or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>

The building type consisted of both residential and commercial. Most of samples examined were evaluated positive for germs and fungi.<p>
