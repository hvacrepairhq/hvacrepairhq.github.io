<p>I am changing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating unit, you may search for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for homeowners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
