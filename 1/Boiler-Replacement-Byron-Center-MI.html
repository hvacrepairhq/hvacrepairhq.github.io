During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product.
