<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils.

It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
