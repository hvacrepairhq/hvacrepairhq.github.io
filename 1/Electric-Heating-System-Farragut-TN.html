<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We selected getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
