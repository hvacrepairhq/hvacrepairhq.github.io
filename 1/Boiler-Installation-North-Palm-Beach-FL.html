<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Production integrates quality products and outstanding service with innovation and technological advances to deliver high-performance heating & cooling items worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external unit.

<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives usually amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial price of a system competitive with standard equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (houses generally utilize between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, brand-new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the best conditions.<p>
