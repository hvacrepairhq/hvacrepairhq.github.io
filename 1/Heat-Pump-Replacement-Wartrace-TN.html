<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally greater than numerous heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the design you acquire.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
