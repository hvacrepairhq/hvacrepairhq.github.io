<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>

<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Cudahy WI</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
