<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Virginia Beach VA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floorings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants exhaust them from the house.<p>
