<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
<p>Yearly furnace maintenance is the best way to keep your heating system working safely and efficiently. That's why we provide our special Comfort First Membership that makes preventive care economical and simple. Ask us about our maintenance program that can conserve you 25 percent on service over the life of your system. Because when you take care of your furnace, it will take care of you with lower energy costs, fewer repairs, and more years of convenience.<p>
