<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
