<p>All cooling contractors ought to start their assessment of your home by performing an Air Conditioning Contractors of America Handbook J load estimation. This figures out the heat get your home is subject to. The computation is reasonably simple to carry out and will expose what size system you need. If the one you're considering wants to determine the best system for your home exclusively on experience, move on to another contractor.
