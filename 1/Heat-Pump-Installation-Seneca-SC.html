<h3>Working of an HVAC System at Seneca SC</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface area itself.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are typically near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
