<h3>Central Heating Installation Service in Miami IN</h3>
<p>Since things ran efficiently without any noise, I was extremely pleased in the beginning. Furthermore, I saw obvious modifications in my electrical power expenses.

In general, it has actually been a good experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the start. But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Insulation in Miami IN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year.

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
