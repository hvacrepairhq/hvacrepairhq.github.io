<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
