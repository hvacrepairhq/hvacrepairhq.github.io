<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
