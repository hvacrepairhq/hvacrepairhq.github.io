<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Don't put the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it because it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow constraint will decrease the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working. They showed up the next day and changed 2 furnaces and make them work.
