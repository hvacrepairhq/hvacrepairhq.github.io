<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Oak Island</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon ends up being caught in buildings and concentrations develop up inside.<p>

<h3>HVAC Company Near Me in Oak Island NC</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
