<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>My oldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did previously. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t actually think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itÃ¢ and low $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
