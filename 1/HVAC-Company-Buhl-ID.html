<p>My oldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
