<p>The answer to the question, What does an HVAC technician do?, will differ somewhat depending on industry of work, specialty, and position. What does not differ is the significance of the work that these technicians do.

They help keep us comfy - and healthy! By supplying a climate controlled environment, refrigeration systems make it possible to store and transport food, medication, and other disposable products.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the same method as a car radiator or typical family a/c does.

It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
