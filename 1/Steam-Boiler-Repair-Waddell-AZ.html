<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Often there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in hidden or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
