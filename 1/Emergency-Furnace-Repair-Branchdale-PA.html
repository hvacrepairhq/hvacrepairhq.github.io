<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is honest, reputable, and affordable on price. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
