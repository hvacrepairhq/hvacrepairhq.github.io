<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Bailey MI</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My wife stated that she had seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have met in a long time.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by qualified HVAC professionals. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of individuals.<p>
