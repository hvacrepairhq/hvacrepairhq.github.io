<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly effective, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature.

COP rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect.
