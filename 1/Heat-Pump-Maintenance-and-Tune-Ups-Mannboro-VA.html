<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less effective.

<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Air pressure differences produced by these forces move air-borne toxins from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>

Your contractor chooses each part of the system separately so that everything operates at leading efficiency to offer the comfort you need. All the system parts are matched-the furnace, the condensing unit, blowers and fans, cooling coil, the duct work-to produce a heating & cooling system that will work best for you.<p>
