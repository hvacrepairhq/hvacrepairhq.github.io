<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Batavia IL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
