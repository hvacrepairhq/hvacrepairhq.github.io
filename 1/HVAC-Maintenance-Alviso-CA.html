<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends upon private sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators utilized flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is extremely effective and helpful, especially throughout the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's home. This is due to the fact that the excess heat absorbed from within the house is performed into the hot water tank instead of being transferred back into the earth. The outcome, therefore, is free warm water! Additionally, throughout winter season, the heat from underground can be soaked up to heat domestic water along with its main purpose of supplying area heating. This implies that cost savings are still realized during the colder period. In reality, a desuperheater lowers winter water heating costs by roughly half.<p>
