AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately.

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with your home. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the examination on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health risk reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new home owner I have actually learned how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
