<p>Remember that the SEER ranking is determined utilizing the very same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The average summer temperature to come to the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the proper SEER rating for your area, deduct 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all brand-new air conditioning units manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>5. Odor excellent naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney aroma with a clean kitchen area or tidy artificial fragrances in laundry items and air fresheners give off dozens of different chemicals into the air.

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
