<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
