<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home.

The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
