<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
