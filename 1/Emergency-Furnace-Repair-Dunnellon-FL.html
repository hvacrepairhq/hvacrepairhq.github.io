<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
