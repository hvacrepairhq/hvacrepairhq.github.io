<p>A/c unit makers typically make rugged, high quality items. Start by inspecting any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
