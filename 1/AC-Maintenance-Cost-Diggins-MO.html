<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can imply substantial savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
