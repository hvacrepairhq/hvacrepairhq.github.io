<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in many cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores. The main threat of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More major than many allergenic properties is the ability of mold to set off episodes face to faces that currently have asthma, a serious respiratory illness.<p>

<h3>Locating Best HVAC Contractors in Redwood City CA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house construction is to reduce air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floors. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that hinders the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a variety of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, disorientation, nausea, and confusion, to fatigue in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest discomfort in individuals with chronic heart disease. The signs of carbon monoxide poisoning are in some cases confused with the flu or food poisoning. Fetuses, babies, senior people, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be particularly conscious carbon monoxide exposures.<p>
