<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
