<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
