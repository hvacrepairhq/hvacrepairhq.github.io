<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%.

<p>New a/c typically range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER ranking implies greater energy efficiency and potentially lower energy bills.

<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
