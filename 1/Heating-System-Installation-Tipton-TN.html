<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
