<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be effectively determined or corrected without a thorough structure investigation.
