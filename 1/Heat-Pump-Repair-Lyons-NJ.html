<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Heat And Air Units Repair in Lyons NJ</h3>
<p>All heater have some level of air filtration. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
