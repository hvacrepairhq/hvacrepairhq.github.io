<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
