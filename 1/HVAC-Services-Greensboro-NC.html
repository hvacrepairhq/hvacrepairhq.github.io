<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
