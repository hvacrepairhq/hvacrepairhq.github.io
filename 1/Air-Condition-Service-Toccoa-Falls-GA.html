<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Toccoa Falls GA</h3>
<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up features when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Plan on investing a number of thousand dollars for the total system if you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house. The size of the system figures out the labor hours involved to build the system. When you think about installation costs upwards of $50 per hour, to equip a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand name brand-new furnace or more.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
