<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
