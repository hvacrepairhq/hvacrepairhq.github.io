<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, given that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
