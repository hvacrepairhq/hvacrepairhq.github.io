<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
