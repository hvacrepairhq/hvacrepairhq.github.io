<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
