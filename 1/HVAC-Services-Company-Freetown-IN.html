<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home.

An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
