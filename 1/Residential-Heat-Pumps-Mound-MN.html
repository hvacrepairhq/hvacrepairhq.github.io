He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.

<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
