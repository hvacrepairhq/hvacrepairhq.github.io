<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
