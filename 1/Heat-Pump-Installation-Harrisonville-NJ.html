<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
