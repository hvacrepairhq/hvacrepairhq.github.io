<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become blocked with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down entirely.
