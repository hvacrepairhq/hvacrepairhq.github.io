<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
