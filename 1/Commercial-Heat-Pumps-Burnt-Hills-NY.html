<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
