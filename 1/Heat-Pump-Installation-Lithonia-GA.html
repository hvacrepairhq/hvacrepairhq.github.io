Indoor air contamination studies have determined numerous contaminants that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion products, volatile organic substances (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these impurities are important in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>

Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies additional info on air-cleaning devices to minimize indoor air pollutants.<p>
