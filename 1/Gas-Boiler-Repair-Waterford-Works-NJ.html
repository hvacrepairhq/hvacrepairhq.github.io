<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
