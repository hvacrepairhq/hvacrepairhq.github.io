<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in gathering info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
