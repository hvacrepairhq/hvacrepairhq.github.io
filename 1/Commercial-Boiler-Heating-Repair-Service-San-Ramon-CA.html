<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, rather than outside or commercial settings.

This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>

<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was understood how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
