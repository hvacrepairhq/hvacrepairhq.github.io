<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
