<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Morgantown PA</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on different home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to carry out the needed electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
