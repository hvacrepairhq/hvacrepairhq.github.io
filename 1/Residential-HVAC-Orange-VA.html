<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
