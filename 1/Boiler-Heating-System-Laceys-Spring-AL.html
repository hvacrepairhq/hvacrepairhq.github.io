<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years.
