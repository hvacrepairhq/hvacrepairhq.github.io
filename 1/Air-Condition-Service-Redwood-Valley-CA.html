<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer advice to change rather than repair a heating system. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
