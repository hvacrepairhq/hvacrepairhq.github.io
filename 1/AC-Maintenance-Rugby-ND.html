<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
