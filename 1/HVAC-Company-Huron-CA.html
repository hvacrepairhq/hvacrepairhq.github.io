<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
