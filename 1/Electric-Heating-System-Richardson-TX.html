Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
