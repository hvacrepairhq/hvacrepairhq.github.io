<p>Ac system can create a great deal of water due to the fact that they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
