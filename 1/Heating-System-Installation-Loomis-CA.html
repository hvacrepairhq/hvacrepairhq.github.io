<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
