<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements.
