<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, workplaces and homes matters, particularly since we spend the majority of our lives inside. A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the ac system is large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>For example, issues occur when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate sufficient amounts of outside air.

Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological impurities that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
