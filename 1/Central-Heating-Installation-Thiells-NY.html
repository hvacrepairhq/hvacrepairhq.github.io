<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible.
