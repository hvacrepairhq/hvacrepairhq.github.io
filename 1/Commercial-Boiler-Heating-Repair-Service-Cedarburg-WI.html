<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They met my needs totally by supplying a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you each time they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was six months prior to the present one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
