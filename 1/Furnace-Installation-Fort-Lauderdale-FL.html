<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
