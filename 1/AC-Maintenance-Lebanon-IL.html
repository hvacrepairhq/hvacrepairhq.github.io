<h3>AC Replacement in Lebanon IL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
