<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While space a/c supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
