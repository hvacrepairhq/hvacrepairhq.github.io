<p>Info provided in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Manufacturers typically continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard enters into effect.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
