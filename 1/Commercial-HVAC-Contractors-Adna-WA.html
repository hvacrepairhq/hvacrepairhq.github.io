<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps should also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners should look out to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization measures must not be carried out up until these problems have been remedied.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be brought on as the outcome of temperature level extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow. Work environment temperatures should be kept in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by excessive air circulation should be avoided.<p>
