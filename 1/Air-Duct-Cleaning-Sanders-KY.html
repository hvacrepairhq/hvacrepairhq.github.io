<p>. Prior to choosing the installation area of a/c, several main aspects need to be thought about.

Secondly, there need to not be any challenges on the way of the air flow that might prevent it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor system needs to likewise be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outdoors and the efficiency of the whole system will drop greatly. It is extremely suggested to set up the air conditioning unit units in easily accessible places, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>
