Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
