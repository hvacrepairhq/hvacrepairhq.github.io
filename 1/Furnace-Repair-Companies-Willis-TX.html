<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
