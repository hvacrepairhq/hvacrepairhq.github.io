<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your ac system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Simply including refrigerant is not an option if it leakages.
