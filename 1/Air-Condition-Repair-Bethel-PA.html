<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
