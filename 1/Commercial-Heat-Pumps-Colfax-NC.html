<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Colfax NC</h3>
<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological contaminants are wet or damp building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Different fungi and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and home plants.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
