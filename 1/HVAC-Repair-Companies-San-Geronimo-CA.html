Newer gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in San Geronimo CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
