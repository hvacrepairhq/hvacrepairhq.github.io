<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be effectively recognized or corrected without a thorough building investigation. These investigations might begin with written surveys and telephone assessments in which building detectives examine the history of resident signs and structure operation treatments. In some cases, these questions may rapidly reveal the problem and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
