Many typical structure products used prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation.

A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is frequently recommended instead.<p>
