<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
