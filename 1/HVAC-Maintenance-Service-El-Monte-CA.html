<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires managed by experts, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
