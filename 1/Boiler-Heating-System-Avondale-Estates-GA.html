<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
