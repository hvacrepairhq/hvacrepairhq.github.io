<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Lots of commercial structures utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also use natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outdoor air presented into a space per a system of time, and is often expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Air-Conditioning, refrigerating and heating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher air flow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air purification technologies are becoming more typical as available services in commercial and residential HVAC item bundles. Adoption of these technologies, nevertheless, has actually not been prevalent, as consumers remain mostly unconcerned to the results of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
