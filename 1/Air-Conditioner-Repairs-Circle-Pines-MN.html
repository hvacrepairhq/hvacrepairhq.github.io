<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
