<p>All Points Heating uses home air conditioning, a/c installation, a/c maintenance that provide reputable, proven performance at high effectiveness. Combustion items from automobile exhaust, furnaces, water heaters, area heating systems, aromatic candle lights, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not appropriately vented can create carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products may result in throat, eye, and nose irritation; tiredness; lightheadedness; and nausea.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations build up inside, direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>
