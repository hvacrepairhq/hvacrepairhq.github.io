<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.

HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
