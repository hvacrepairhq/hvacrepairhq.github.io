<p>These people have been excellent. At a realtor, I often need contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a house might cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these people twice. They came out rapidly and offered me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my client probably would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, its a company design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>

<p>You could update to the highest performance gear offered and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The average house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician ought to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air leaves the system.<p>

<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Lavonia GA</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
