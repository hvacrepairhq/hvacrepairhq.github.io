<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
