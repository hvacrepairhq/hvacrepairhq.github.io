<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
