Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
