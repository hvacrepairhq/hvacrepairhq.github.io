They weren't cheap however a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the new part. I was extremely happy they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
