<p>Some biological impurities trigger allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Infectious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing contaminants.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
