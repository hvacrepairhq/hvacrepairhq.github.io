<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, there has been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have actually been shown to decrease levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no proof, nevertheless, that a reasonable variety of houseplants get rid of considerable amounts of pollutants in homes and workplaces.
