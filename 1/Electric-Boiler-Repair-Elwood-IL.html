<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Elwood IL</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure.

The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit.

<h3>HVAC Cleaning in Elwood IL</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
