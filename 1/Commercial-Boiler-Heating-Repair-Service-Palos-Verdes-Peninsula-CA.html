<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration. Generally, SEER offers more data based on how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>

<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
