There have been awkward sounds. I got it fixed and inspected. I am hoping that is completion of the concern. In general, it has been a good experience. Reliable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the start. However then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Numerous elements affect IAQ. These aspects consist of poor ventilation (lack of outside air), issues controlling temperature, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air coming into the building. Sometimes, specific impurities like dust from building or renovation, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including percentages of chemicals released as a gas in time) might cause bad IAQ.<p>
