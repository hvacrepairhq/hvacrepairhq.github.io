HVAC professionals suggest following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new.

The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll need to clean them.
