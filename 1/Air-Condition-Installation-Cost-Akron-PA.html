<p>A specialized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room.

A lot of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.
