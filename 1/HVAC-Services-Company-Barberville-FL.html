<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years ago and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
