<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven.
