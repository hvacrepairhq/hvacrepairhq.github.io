<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
