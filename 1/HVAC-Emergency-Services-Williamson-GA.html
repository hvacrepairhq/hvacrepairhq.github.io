<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Duct are responsible for dispersing hot and cold air throughout your house, offering a comfortable environment in every room.
