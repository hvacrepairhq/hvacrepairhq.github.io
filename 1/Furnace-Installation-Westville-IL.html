The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power must not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it considers not just the small power of the units, however likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer.
