<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
