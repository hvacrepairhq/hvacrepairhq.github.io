<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan does not. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan begins. , if it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at East Earl PA</h3>

Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls work to make sure the fans run for an enough period of time. An excellent guideline is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
