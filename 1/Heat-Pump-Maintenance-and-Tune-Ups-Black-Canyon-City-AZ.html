<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the home. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and germs, animal dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
