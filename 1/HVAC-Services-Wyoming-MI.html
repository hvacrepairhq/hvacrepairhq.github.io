Depending upon the site and bug to be managed, several of the following steps can be efficient: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and frequent cleaning of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be reduced or prevented by ensuring that wood structure materials do not enter direct contact with the soil and by storing firewood far from the house. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be drastically lowered.<p>
