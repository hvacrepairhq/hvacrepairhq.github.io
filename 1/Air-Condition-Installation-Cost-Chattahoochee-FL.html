<h3>Furnace Installation in Chattahoochee FL</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to assess scenario & chose to opt for them for the work. I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke with from beginning to end were extremely professional, polite and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>

<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
