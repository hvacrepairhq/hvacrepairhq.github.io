<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter.

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
