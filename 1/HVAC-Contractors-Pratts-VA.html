<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Pratts Virginia</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services at Pratts VA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment.
