<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
