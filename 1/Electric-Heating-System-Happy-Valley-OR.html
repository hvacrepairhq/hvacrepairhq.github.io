<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Happy Valley OR?</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
