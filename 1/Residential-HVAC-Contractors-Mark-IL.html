<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, since the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.
