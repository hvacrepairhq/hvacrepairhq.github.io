<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
