<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has ended up being an important issue to homeowners and health experts. Indoor air contamination research studies have actually identified a number of contaminants that can be present in indoor air.

Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these pollutants are necessary in maintaining great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The first a/c unit and refrigerators utilized combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
