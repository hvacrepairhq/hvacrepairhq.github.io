<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has actually become an important concern to house owners and health professionals. Indoor air pollution research studies have actually identified several impurities that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion products, unstable natural substances (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Correct ventilation and removal of the sources of these contaminants are necessary in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized.
