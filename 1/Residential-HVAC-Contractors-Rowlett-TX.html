<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on uncommon celebrations.<p>
