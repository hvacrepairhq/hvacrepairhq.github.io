<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in location. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive use of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  a really useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
