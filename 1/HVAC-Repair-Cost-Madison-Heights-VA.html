<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
