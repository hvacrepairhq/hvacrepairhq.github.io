<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological threat to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled.

<p>The main reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services used. If the system is brand-new and still under a producer's service warranty, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any significant repairs must be covered under the producer's warranty. However, some producers require routine maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Moreover, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one reaction stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to holes and cracks. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
