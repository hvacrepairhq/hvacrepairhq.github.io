<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
