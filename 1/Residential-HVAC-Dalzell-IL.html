Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like an area heating unit) with the exact same quantity of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
