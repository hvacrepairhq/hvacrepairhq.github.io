If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
