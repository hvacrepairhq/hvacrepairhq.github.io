<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
