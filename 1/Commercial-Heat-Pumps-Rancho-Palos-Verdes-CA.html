<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
