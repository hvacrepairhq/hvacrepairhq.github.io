<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>

Likewise, if the process doesn't work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you need to do it often, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
