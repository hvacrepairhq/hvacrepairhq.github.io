<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
