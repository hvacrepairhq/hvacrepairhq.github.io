<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working.

<p>During normal furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can build up on internal parts.
