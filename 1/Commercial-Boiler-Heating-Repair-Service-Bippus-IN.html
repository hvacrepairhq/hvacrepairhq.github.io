<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who operates in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used around the globe, including EMV.

<p>Just like most home improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can vary commonly based upon the size of the house. A lot of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner need to think about heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
