<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
