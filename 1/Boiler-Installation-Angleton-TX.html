<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
