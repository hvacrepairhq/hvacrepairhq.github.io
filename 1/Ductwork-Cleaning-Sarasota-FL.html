Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
