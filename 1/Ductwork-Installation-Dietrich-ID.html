<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
