<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit.

<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace at Rising Sun IN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenditures.
