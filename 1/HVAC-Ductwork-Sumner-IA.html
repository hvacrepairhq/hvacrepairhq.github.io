The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
