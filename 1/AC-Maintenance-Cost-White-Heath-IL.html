<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a series of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weak point, disorientation, confusion, and nausea, to tiredness in healthy people and episodes of increased chest pain in people with chronic heart disease. The signs of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are in some cases confused with the flu or food poisoning. Fetuses, babies, senior individuals, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing illness can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide direct exposures.<p>
