<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and dirty. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's efficiency. To make certain the system is working effectively, think about having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
