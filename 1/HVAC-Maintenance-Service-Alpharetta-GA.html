<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Chemical pollutants: Volatile natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; furnishings, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and repaired extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
