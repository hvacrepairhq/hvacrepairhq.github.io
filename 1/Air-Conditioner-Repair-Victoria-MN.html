<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health results discussed.

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
