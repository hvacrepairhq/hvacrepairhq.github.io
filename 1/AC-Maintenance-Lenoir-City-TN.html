<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My better half stated that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good individuals I have actually satisfied in a long time.

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
