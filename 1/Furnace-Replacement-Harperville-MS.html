<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to offer adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
