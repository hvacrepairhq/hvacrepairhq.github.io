Ventilation, a common technique of minimizing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will minimize but not get rid of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not remove them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up since smoking produces such big amounts of contaminants.

Subsequently, the most efficient method to reduce direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to get rid of smoking cigarettes there.<p>
