<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
