<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
