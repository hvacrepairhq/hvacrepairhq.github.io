<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Jenkinsville SC</h3>
<p>A split cooling system may cost close to that of a standard HVAC system however has shown to be an alternative cost reliable alternative to houses that do not have ductwork. Used along with other forms of heating or cooling, such as portable or window ac system, area heaters, or oil heaters, it can boost the comfort of your home while keeping your regular monthly energy expense sensible.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
