<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
