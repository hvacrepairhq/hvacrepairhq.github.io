<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Monroe NC?</h3>
<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
