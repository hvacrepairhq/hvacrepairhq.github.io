Protexs deal was among the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
