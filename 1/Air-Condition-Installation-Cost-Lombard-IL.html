<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they need to be positioned. Many frequently they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly stay seated in that particular area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending upon what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to put the sensing unit appropriately.

Pushed wood products made for indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
