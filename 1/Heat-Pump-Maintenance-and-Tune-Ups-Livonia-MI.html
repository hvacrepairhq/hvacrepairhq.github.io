<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Livonia Michigan</h3>
<p>If your furnace has actually just passed away in sub-zero temperatures or your air conditioner has actually gone kaput on a blistering day, you'll probably be grateful to work with the first repairman who concerns your home that day.

<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved issues. I would advise this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Numerous detach blocks contain two cartridge fuses. Check them prior to you continue with repairs (Picture 3). A blown fuse is a sign of a failing part inside the condensing unit. So don't just change it and believe you've solved the problem. Rather, change the parts we show here. Then install new fuses and fire up the system. If it blows once again, call a pro-- you've got more major issues.<p>
