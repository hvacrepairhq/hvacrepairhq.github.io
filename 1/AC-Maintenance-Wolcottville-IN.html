<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
