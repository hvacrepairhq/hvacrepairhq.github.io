But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
