<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to outdoor or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for distributing cold and hot air throughout your home, offering a comfy climate in every room. However ducts that are not set up effectively or kept can distribute impurities from one space to another.
