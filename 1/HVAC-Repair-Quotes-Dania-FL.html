<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
