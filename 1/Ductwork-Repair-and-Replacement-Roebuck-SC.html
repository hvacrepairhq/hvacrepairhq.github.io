<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it might simply need to be cleaned. Whether this is the cause of the problem, it's a great early treatment to try. Plan to do this on a fairly warm day. Never ever use a power washer for this-- it can harm the fins. The following are standards; constantly refer to your owner's handbook. Note: Always shut off the power before cleaning the unit.<p>
