<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay items. The efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain due to the fact that they just partially remove the radon decay products and do not decrease the amount of radon entering the home.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers more details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out.

<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is frequently tough to measure, as one action specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided.

For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.  a very helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
