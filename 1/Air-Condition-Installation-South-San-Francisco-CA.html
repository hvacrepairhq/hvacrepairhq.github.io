<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
