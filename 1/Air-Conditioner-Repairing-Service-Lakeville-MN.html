<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
