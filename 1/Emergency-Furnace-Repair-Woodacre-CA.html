<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
