<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
