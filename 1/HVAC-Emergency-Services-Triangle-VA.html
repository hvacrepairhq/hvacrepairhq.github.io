<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer.

<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still heats up to the right temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. If your house is not heating up, only be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you need to call in a professional to repair the system and inspect.<p>

<p>Glowing heating systems do not utilize ducts, which makes them quite a bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also don't create cold and hot areas. All of the heat that radiant heating systems disperse moves through solid items, keeping the heat near the floor of the space where it is the most use. Radiant heating systems can also heat rooms with less energy invested, and keep them warmed for longer, considering that many floorings tend to retain heat better than air does.<p>
