<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
