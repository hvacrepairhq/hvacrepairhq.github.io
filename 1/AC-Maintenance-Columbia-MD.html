<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Columbia MD Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside your home may trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>There's a huge difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical kind of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of houses in colder climates were heated up by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, ceilings and floors warmed. In turn, the things in the room, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
