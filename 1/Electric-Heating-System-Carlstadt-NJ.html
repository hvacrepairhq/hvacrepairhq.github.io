<p>Inquire about training and certifications. An excellent place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that perfect temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
