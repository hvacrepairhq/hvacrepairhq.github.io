<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
