But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
