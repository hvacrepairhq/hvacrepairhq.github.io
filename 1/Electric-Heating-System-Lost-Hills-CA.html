<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
