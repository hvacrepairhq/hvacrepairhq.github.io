<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
