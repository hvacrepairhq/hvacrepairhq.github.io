<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it.

Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.)
