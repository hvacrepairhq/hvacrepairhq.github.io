<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
