<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heatpump must be devoid of all blockages and debris. Blockages can block the flow of condensed water and cause moisture build-up within the system. Excess moisture can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, irregular temperature level regulation, bacteria, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to make sure all excess moisture flows away from the system.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>To establish a safe assessment or visit with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your area in an online search. Message or call specialists to ask whether they can carry out a consultation over the phone and even over a video call. In this manner, they can assess the issue without increasing the threat of virus transmission by visiting your home.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
