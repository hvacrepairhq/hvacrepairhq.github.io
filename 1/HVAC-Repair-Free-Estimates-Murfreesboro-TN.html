<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Never Ignore in Murfreesboro TN</h3>
<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological contaminants are wet or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Various fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
