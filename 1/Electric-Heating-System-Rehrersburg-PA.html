<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. Many house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
