<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically important to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out.
