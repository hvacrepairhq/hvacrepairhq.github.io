<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and harden-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>

In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run before the compound had actually treated.
