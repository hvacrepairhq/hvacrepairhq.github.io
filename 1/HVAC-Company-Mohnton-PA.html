<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
