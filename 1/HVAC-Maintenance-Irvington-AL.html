<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in location.

For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  a really advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
