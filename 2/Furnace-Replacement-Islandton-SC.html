<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are normally smaller sized than stick-built homes and utilize substantially less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat. Expect the average mobile home oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as lots of brand names produce oil furnaces for this usage, and you may find more options with gas, propane, or electric heating systems.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
