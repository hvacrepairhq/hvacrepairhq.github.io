Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that protect your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good possibility; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen.

There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual events.<p>
