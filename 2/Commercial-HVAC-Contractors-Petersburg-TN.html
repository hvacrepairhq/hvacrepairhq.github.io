<h3>Heating Installation in Petersburg TN</h3>
<p>Home heating systems are complicated systems that need the services of a contractor to install. While you can certainly purchase your furnace yourself, many contractors won't warranty the furnace or might not install it if you do not buy it from them. Installation fees vary across the county, but begin at roughly $50 per hour up to $150 or more. It takes around five hours to install a small furnace and more to install a big one.<p>
