In this case, the heatpump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>There's a huge distinction between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of homes in cooler environments were heated by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, ceilings and floors warmed. In turn, the objects in the space, like furnishings and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
