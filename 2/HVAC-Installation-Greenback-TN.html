This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

More recent gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
