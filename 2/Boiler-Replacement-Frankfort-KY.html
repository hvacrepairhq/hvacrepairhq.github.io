<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>When your house's furnace quits working, your home can have more issues than just being unpleasant. Every moment that your heating unit is off also places your pipelines at the threat of freezing. When pipelines freeze, they can burst and cause considerable damage to your house.
