It protects the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or pollutants because the energy used to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements totally by offering a professional quote with options, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
