<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Air Condition Installation in Peoria Arizona</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Many HVAC entrepreneur don't understand they require different pricing schemes for various services that their company offers. For instance, residential HVAC installation should be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service must be priced in a different way from duct cleaning. If you are providing more than one service, you ought to separate these into different departments, as if they were their own separate business.<p>

<h3>Passive Ventilation in Peoria AZ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
