<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold development and must be discarded. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in surprise or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
