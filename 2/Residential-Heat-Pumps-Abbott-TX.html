While you can certainly buy your furnace yourself, most contractors will not service warranty the furnace or may not install it if you don't buy it from them.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>

This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, or even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
