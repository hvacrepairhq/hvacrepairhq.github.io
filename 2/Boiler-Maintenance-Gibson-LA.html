<p>Professional heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>

If your system is near, or past, its expected life expectancy, replacement may be the most economical solution.<p>
