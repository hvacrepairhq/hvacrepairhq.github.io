<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin arising from gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older houses might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchens and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are typically higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
