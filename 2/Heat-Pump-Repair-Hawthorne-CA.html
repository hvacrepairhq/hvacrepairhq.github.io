<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Hawthorne CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
