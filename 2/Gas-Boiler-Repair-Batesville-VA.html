<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, given that it is secured inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
