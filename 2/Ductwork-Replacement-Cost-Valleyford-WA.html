<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites should find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the truth of a harsh, cruel summer.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of brand-new homes are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home.
