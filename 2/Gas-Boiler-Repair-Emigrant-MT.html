<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain.

<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Emigrant MT</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>I have become fairly skilled at looking into items on line prior to purchasing them. However I don't discover that there is a central area for browsing details about the "real" value of house HVAC systems or perhaps I ought to state a truthful assessment of these products.
