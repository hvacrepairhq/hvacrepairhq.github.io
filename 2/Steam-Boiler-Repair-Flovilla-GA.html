It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
