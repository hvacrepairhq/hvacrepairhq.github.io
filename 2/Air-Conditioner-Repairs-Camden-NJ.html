As a result your oil or natural gas furnace might run longer to offer the exact same quantity of heat. This will trigger your energy bills to go up. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis could be utilized to help you pay for a new, much more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace.

<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
