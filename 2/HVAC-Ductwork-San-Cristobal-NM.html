Maybe it is time to start thinking about purchasing a brand-new one if your furnace is in a really bad condition.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.
