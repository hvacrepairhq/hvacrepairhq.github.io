<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
