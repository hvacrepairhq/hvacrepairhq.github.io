<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
