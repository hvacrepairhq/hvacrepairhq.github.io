<p>Check these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers.
