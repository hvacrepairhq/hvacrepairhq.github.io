<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Gwynedd PA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
