Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
