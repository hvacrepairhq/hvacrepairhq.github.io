<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
