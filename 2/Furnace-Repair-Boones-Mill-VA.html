<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
