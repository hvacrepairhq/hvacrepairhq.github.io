<p>All homes require effective ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other workplaces is very important not only for employees' comfort but likewise for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to signs like headaches, fatigue, problem concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some particular illness have actually been linked to specific air contaminants or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate symptoms but can cause cancer after many years.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types.
