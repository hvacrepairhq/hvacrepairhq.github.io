<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the home.

Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
