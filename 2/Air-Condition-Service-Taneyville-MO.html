<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand.

Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
