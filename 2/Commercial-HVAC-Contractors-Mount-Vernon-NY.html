<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
