<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
