<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

Ron had actually identified the problem area in examining the bill. He solved the issue in one day, had actually changed the bill to what I considered reasonable prior to he called back, understood what might have caused the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not happen once again. I have actually considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
