<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues.

Kids might have higher exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
