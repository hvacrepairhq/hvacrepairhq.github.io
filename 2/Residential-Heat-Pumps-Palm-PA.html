<p>There are lots of sources of indoor air pollution in any house. These consist of combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, tobacco, coal, and wood items; structure products and furnishings as diverse as scrubby, asbestos-containing insulation, damp or wet carpet, and cabinetry or furnishings made of specific pushed wood items; items for home cleaning and maintenance, personal care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling systems and humidification devices; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outdoor air contamination.<p>
<p>When installing radiant heating, you must provide serious thought to the type of flooring covering in the home. Because it carries out and shops heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work fairly well.

Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
