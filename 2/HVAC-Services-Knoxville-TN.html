Initially, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider utilizing solid wood items. Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet.
