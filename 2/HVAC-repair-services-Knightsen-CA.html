<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
