<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time.

We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding.
