<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
