<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Dana Point CA</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
