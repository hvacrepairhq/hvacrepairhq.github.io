"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
