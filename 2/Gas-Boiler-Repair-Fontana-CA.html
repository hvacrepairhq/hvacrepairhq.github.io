<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
