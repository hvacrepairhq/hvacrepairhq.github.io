<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply radiant systems.

When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is usually recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
