<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
