<p>A health survey ought to be developed and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool ought to recognize the number of individuals affected; define ages and task descriptions of involved employees; determine where they lie within the office; suggest when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health symptoms or diseases; determine all devices operated in the office; suggest the type of outside air pollution; and recognize prospective sources of job tension.<p>
<p>We look at hints before we supply suggestions to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy.

It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
