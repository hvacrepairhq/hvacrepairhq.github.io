<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
