Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Port Royal KY</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
