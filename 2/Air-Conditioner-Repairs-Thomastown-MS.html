<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not provide contracts.  The so called reputable companies rip off more people than the fly by night attire. Since I attempted to work for them, I understand. I quit since 90% of them are criminals. They walk in with or without an agreement and start selling you things you don't require. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as a specialist to validate the so called problems and solutions. 9 out of 10, I inspect are totally incorrect.<p>
<p>Radiant heating includes installing coils or pipes in the floor, offering heat from below and moving up. It provides an even, overall heat temperature throughout the space.
