<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Hiring Rancho Santa Fe CA HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually take place. For the most part, the belt is improperly aligned or worn and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under A/c Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Rancho Santa Fe CA</h3>
<p>To identify the correct size of oil furnace you need for your home, determine the home's square video and identify what zone your house remains in. Speak With the U.S. Energy Info Administration's climate zone map to determine your zone number. Multiply the length and width of each space in your house that you heat and accumulate all the rooms together to get your overall square video footage.<p>
<p>Immediate results might show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are typically short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Signs of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also appear soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an option for homeowners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
