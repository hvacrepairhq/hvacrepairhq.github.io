<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
