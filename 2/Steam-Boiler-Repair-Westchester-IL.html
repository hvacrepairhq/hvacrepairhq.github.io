<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Westchester IL</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
