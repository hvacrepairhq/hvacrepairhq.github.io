Some effects may be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>Individuals who dislike these pollutants ought to utilize allergen-proof mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and avoid room home furnishings that accumulate dust, specifically if they can not be washed in hot water.
