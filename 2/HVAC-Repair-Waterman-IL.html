If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home.

Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
