<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
