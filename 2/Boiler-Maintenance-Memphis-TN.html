<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
