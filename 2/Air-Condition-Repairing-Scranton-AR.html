One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great opportunity; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace.
