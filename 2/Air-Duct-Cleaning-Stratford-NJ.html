<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
