<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in Bradley South Carolina</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
