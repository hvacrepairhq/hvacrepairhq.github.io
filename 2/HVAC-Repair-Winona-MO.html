<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in Winona MO</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
