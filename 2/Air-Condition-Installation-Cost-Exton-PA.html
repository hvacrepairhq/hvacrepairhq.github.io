<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Exton PA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>The bureau projects 34 percent work growth for HVAC specialists between 2010 and 2020, more than two times the average for all occupations.
