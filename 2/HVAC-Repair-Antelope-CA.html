<h3>Working of a HVAC System in Antelope CA</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the essential electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
