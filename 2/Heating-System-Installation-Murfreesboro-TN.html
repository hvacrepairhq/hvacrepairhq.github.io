<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, just including refrigerant is not an option. A skilled technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate quantity of refrigerant.

Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
