<p>Heaters as they age run the risk of establishing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, could leakage into your house undiscovered. Indications of this may be frequent headaches, a burning sensation in nose or eyes, nausea, disorientation, flu-like symptoms. Ought to you experience any of these, air out your home, open a window to the furnace space and right away call a service technician. Fractures in the heat exchanger can take place undiscovered which is why nobody advises waiting up until they take place.

<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still does not work properly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
