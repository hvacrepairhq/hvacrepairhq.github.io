PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space air conditioning provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
