<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
