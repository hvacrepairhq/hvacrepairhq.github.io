Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
