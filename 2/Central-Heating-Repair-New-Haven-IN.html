For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
