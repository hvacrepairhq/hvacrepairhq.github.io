<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit.
