<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still heats up to the ideal temperature.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.
