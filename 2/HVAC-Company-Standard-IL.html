For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
