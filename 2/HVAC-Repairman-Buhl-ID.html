<p>There are a few main things that homeowners will wish to take into account when choosing which of the best AC systems they should install in their homes. It truly depends upon what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioner. The significant factors for a lot of house owners will be the total cost to install the best air conditioner brands, life expectancy of the AC system, warranties offered, energy performance (SEER ratings), and size of the system you need for your home's square footage (LOADS) to effectively cool your house.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
