<p>Trace was the service technician that took care of my semi yearly maintenance today. Trace was on time, courteous, and appreciated my house by constantly using boot coverings when entering my home. He demonstrated the points of assessment and also suggested I have a UV light installed due to a small buildup of mold accumulating in the air handler, which he completely inspected and cleaned up the outside compressor coils as well as ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He likewise removed the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor system and recommended a service to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I got a detailed e-mail report of the inspection outlining all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I highly recommend him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very crucial to keeping a proper temperature level.<p>
