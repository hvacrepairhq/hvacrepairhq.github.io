<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
