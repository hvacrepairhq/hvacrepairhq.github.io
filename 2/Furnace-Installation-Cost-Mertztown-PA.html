The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank must be looked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed occasionally to eliminate tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas). The systems should be checked at least twice each year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to get rid of dust gathered in order to improve collector performance.<p>

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have been properly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
