<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
