<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%.

<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
