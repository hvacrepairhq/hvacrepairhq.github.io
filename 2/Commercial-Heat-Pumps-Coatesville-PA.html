<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no impurity sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it might flatter twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed simply a couple of years earlier.<p>
