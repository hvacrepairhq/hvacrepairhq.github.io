<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
