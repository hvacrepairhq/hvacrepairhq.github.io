<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Griffin GA</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both need to be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
