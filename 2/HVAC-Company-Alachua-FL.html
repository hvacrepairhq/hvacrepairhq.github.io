<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
