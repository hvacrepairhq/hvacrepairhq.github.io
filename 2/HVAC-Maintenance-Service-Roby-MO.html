<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same.

The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
