<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They include delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more conscious the harmful effects of lead. Kids might have greater exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<h3>Facts All Clifton CO Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in roofings, walls, and floorings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
