If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water generally picks up lead inside the house from household pipes that is made with lead products. The only way to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.
