<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE).

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
