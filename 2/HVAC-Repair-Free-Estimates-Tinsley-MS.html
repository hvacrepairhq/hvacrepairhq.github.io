<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
