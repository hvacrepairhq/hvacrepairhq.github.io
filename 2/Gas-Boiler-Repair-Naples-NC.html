<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced.

<p>There are some more serious risks for HVAC workers that might be potentially deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be poisonous. As HVAC technicians regularly enter into contact with circuitry, they risk being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of abrasions and burns to the skin. Although there are threats related to the task, it is normally performed safely as long as correct care is taken.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Exposure Assessment Method (GROUP) research studies found levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside homes than outdoors, regardless of whether the houses were located in rural or extremely industrial areas. Extra GROUP research studies show that while people are utilizing items including natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to extremely high pollutant levels, and raised concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is completed.<p>

<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>These guys have been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a home might cost. Just recently I needed to call on these people two times. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, it's an organisation design they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>
