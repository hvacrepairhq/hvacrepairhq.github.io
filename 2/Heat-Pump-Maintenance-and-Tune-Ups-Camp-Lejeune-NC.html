<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
