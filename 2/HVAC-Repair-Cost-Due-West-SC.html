What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
