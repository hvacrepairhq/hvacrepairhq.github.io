<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the floor or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
