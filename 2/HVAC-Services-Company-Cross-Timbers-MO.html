<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
