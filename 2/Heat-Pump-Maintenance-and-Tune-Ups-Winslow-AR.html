<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Winslow AR</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines installed under the flooring or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
