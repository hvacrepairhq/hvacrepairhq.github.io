<h3>HVAC Services in Cupertino California</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Cupertino CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
