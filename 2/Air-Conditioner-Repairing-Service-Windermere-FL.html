<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally effective, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
