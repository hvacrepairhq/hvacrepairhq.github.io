<p>Self-installation tends to develop more issues than it solves. In fact, it often triggers professional intervention anyway to fix a few of the issues that were developed during the installation.

<p>Some health effects may show up quickly after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a pollutant.

In some cases the treatment is simply eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Right after exposure to some indoor air contaminants, symptoms of some illness such as asthma may show up, be intensified or worsened.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
