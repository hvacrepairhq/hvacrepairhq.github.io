<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the home. Pollutants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air toxin might likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and bacteria, animal dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

There is presently no proof, nevertheless, that a sensible variety of houseplants get rid of substantial amounts of contaminants in houses and workplaces. Since excessively damp soil may promote the growth of bacteria which can affect allergic people, indoor houseplants must not be over-watered.<p>
