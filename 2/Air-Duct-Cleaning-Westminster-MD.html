<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.

<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Westminster MD?</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need reasonably little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is necessary to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be looked for leakages, the system ought to be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems must be examined a minimum of two times annually for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to get rid of dust collected in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.
