<p>The purpose of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at reasonable energy expenses. Load determining is described as the Manual J estimation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for a/c.

<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they identified the issue and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
