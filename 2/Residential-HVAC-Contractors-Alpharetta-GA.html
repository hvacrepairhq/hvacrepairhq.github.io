Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
