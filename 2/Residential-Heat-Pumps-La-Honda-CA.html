<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
