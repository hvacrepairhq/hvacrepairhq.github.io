<h3>Gas Furnace Service in Fountain Inn SC</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's probably your problem.
