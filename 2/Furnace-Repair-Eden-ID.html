<p>The main factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services provided. The cost might not be beneficial if the system is brand-new and still under a maker's guarantee. Any major repairs need to be covered under the maker's service warranty. Nevertheless, some makers need regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
