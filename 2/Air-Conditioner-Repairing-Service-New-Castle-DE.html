<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
