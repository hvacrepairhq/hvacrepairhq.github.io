<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
