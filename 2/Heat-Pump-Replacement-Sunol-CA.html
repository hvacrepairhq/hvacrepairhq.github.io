<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
