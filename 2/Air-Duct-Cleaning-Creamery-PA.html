<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
