<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Remember that the SEER ranking is calculated utilizing the same set of temperature levels across the board. The average summer season temperature level to get to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the right SEER rating for your area, deduct 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new air conditioning systems made in the United States.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as a very efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of permitting heat to warm up the concrete piece listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
