Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
