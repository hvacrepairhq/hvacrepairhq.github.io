<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
