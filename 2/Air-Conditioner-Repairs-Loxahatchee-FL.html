<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site.

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in location.

If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
