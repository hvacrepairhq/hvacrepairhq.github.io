<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Morgan Hill CA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
