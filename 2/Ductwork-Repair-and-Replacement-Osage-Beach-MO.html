<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
