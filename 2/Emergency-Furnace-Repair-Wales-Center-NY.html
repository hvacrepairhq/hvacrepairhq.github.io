<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works in Wales Center NY?</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>
