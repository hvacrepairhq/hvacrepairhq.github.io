We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic.

<p>Most well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water generally gets lead inside the house from family plumbing that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked, the only way to know. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house might not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To find odors in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, since the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
