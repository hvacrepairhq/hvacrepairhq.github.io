<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% performance, this can mean considerable savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance gos to per year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and generally some other benefits.
