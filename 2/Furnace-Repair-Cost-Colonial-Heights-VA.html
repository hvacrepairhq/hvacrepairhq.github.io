<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in concealed or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
