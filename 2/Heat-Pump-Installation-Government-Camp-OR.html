<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
