<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ may observe unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
