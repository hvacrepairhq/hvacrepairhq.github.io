<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this.
