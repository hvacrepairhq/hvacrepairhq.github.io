<p>Enhance your services, make more services revenue, and provide an incredible client experience. To ensure the unit you pick is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load calculation estimate to determine the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we do not just replace it with the exact same size unit you currently have. These estimations take into account things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is necessary so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
