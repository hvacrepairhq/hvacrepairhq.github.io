<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>Location the solar storage tank near the traditional hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
