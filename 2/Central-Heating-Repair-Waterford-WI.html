<p>Terrific Item! Delivery was kind of weird being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we fixed problems. I would advise this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

<p>Before you select a contractor, think about bids from at least three to 5 credible contractors. Talk to your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no client problems have actually been submitted which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is legitimate and active.

<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases exposure to pollutants during cooking. Improper modification, typically suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. Think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you purchase a new gas range or range. Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your home. When the fireplace is in use, always make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
