Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
