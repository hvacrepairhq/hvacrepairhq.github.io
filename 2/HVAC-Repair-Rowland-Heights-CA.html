<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales guy concerns your house he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and ought to not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>
