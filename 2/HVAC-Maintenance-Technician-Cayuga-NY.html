<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
