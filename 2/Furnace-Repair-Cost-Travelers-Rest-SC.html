By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can typically be done in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
