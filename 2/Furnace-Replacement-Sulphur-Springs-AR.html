Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar.

However a lot of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne impurities in their homes and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Radiant heating offers a variety of distinct benefits over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not need to worry about duct leakages, which are responsible for output losses of up to 30% in other heating system types. Transferring heat through solid items will also cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a radiant system will warm up faster, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the many benefits that a radiant heat system can use you.<p>
