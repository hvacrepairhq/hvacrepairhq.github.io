<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>We take a look at hints prior to we supply recommendations to change rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
