<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
