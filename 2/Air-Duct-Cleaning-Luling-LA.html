Many common structure materials utilized before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the elimination process, removal of asbestos-containing products is not constantly ideal. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is often recommended instead.<p>
