In an included system like a home, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones till a balance is attained.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the entire surface area of a floor heats up the lower half of the room, covering residents in warmth at a lower general temperature-- in some cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heater." Simply put, in-floor heating systems supply a different mode and level of comfort. And, as numerous public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfy we feel, the more inclined we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>
