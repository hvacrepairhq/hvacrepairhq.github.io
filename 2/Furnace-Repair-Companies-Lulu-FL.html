<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
