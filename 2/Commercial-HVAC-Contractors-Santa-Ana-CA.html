<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Santa Ana CA</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation service totally flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
