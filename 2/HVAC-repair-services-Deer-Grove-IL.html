<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a range of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has determined structure products, furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, however much of the risk also originates from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge problem in the establishing world.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
