<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most economical if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>A third method to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, look for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your home may not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To discover smells in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, people exhale co2, which in little amounts is not harmful, but might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to build up. Bacteria or micro-organisms might also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the whole work environment or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
