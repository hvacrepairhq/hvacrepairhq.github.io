<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
