<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

He also removed the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor unit and suggested a service to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I got a comprehensive email report of the evaluation outlining all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I extremely advise him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
