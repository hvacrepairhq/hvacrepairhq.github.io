<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is frosty, the evaporator coil is probably frozen.

<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Riegelsville PA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
