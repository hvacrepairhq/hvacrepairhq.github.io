<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For San Anselmo CA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
