<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Just a specialist can properly identify why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears weird or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call a professional. Similarly, if the process does not work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to analyze the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you have to do it often, it's most likely time for an expert opinion.<p>
