Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same duration.
