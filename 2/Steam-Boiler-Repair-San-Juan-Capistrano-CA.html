<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works at San Juan Capistrano CA?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified agent from a company or seller to do the installation. If you pick to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed individual to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the a/c system. A voided service warranty will not do you any good need to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the get-go and work with a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
