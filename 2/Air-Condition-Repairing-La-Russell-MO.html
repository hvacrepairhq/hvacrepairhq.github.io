<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
