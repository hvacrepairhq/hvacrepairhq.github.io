<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators utilized harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Filtering need to have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can minimize the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to preserving a proper temperature level.<p>

There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
