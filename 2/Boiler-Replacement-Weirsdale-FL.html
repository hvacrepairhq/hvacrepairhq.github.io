<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits annually, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and usually some other advantages. Some companies provide priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
