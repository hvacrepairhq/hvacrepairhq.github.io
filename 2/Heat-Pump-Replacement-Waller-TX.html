<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively solidify and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
