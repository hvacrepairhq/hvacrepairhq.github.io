Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.
