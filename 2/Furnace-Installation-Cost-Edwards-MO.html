<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. Many home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors remove impurities directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
