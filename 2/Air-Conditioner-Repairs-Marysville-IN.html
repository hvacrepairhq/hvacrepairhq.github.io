Your heating unit will strive for you, but like your cars and truck, doing regular and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid issues, and keep your service warranty undamaged.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>3.
