<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood products used adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items produced indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
