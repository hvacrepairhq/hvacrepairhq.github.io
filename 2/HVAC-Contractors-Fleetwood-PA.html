<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner in Fleetwood PA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
