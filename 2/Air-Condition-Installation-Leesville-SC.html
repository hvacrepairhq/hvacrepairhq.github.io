<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be set up to provide threshold informs. If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your monitoring equipment to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
