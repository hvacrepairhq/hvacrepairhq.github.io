<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a large seller who asked not to be called because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in shops to minimize costs (particularly at night) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an appropriate range that might avoid customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>It is also advised for locals of Redmond to have access to heating systems inside their houses. During the winter, furnaces offer enough heating power to houses in the neighborhood. The typical daytime temperature level highs throughout December, January, and February range from the mid-40s to low-50s. Temperatures will drop listed below freezing at night, and heavy precipitation is common during the winter months. When properly installed and well preserved, heaters provide enough heating power to Redmond, Washington homes.<p>
