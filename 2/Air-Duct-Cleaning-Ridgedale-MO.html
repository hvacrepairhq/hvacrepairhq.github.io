<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
