While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
