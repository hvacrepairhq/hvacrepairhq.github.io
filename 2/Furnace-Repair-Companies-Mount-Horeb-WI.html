<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

At present, not much is known about what health results happen from the levels of organics usually discovered in homes.
