<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work effectively in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electricity, a heat pump is a cost-efficient option utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, however in reverse.

<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, infants, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

In some circumstances, particular testing for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of building tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be checked every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
