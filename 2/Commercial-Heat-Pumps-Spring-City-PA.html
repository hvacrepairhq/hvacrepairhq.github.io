The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
