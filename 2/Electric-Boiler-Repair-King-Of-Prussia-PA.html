<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat.

The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.

<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in King Of Prussia PA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
