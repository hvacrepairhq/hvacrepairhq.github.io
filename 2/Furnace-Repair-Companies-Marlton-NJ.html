<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product over time.
