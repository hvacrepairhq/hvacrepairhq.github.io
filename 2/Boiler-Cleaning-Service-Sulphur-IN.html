<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in big commercial buildings can not be efficiently determined or fixed without a thorough building examination. These investigations might start with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building detectives evaluate the history of occupant symptoms and building operation procedures. In some cases, these inquiries might quickly reveal the problem and on-site check outs are unnecessary.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might discover musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may pick to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit. Nevertheless, considering current modifications in refrigerants and cooling designs, it might be wiser to replace the entire system.<p>
