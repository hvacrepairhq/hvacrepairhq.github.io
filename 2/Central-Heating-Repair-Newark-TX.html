<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every 4 years. The Basics Handbook consists of heating and cooling computations.

Other useful referral materials consist of items from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we called two local companies for bids. While both were informative and handy, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heater and situated ways we could have more even heat. He consisted of these substantial but minor adjustments in his quote. We chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump since of current warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>

<h3>Boiler Replacement in Newark TX</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
