<p>Although commercial geothermal systems have been in existence considering that the mid-90s, and the concept developed much earlier than that, its application in houses is still relatively new. That indicates there are fewer expert installers than with standard systems, and less competitors means higher costs. In general, because it is still not commonly adopted, it can likewise be a challenge to discover knowledgeable installers at your area.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Consider purchasing an energy-efficient design if your air conditioner is old.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
