<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
