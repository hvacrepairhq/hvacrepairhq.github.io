A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely.

And mortar manufacturers may refuse warranty protection if you do not follow their directions.<p>
