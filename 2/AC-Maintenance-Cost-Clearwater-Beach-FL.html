<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
