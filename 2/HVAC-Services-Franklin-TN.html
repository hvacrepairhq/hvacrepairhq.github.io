The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
