<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
