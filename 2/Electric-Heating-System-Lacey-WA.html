<p>New air conditioners generally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER rating suggests higher energy effectiveness and possibly lower energy costs. A great SEER rating for you depends on your house size, where you live and other factors. Even the minimally enabled SEER score is going to be much more energy effective than your existing, old air conditioning system. It's not constantly about choosing the model with the highest SEER score, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating unit. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which instantly closed down the heat pump if temperatures reach and drop listed below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>
