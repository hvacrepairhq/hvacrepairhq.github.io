<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
