<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring finish.

<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
