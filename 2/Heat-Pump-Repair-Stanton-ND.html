Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can lower the performance of the coils.<p>

The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and collected impurities (scaling in hard water areas).

<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to routinely clean up the condenser coil.
