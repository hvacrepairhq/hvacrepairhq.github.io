<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
