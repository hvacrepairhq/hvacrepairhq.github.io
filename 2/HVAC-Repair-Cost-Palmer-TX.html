<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same.

Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
