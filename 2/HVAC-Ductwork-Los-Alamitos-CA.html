<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
