<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
