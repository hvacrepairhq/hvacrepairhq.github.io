<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
