<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
