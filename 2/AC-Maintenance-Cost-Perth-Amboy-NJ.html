<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
