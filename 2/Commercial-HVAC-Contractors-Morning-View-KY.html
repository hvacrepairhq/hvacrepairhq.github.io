<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However a number of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne contaminants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to produce a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-410a and r-404a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already commonly used in residential refrigeration.<p>
