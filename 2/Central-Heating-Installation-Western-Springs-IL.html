<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not provide contracts.. The so called trusted companies dupe more people than the fly by night attire. I understand since I attempted to work for them. I give up because 90% of them are crooks. They walk in with or without a contract and begin selling you things you don't need. They lie. How do I know. I now work as a consultant to verify the so called solutions and problems. 9 out of 10, I inspect are entirely incorrect.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.
