<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
