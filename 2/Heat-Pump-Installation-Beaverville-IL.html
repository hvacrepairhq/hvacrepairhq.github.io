<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater because the specialists thought they just didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
