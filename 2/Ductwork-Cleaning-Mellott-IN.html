<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later).

The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
