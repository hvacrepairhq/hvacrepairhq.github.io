<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Bensenville IL</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
