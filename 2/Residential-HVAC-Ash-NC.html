<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
