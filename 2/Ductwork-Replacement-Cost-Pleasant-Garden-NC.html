<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is often hard to measure, as one response specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repetitive usage of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  a really beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
