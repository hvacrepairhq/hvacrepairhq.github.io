"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

If you've evaluated the air in your house and found a radon issue, and you have a well, call a lab licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
