<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is honest, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
