<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
