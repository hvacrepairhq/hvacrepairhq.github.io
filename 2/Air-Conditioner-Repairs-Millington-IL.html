<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
