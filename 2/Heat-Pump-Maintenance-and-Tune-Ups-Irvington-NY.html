Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil.
