<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler house in the hot summer.<p>

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
