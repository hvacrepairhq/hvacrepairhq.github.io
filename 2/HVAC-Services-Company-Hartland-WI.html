All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue.

<p>The primary factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services used.
