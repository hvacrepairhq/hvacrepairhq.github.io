<p>A primary factor in the avoidance of health signs is an effective, properly created and operating ventilation system. The ventilation system determines the quality of the indoor air by controlling the amount of air that is contributed to the office atmosphere, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its contaminants are either exhausted to the re-circulated or outside throughout the structure.<p>
<p>To be truthful, few of the facilities managers who use our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us because of that. Typically they were at first thinking about remotely monitoring some other element of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
