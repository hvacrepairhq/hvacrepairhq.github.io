<p>People have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint due to the fact that these activities create large quantities of lead dust. Consult your state health or housing department for suggestions on which private labs or public firms might have the ability to help test your house for lead in paint. Home test kits can not discover percentages of lead under some conditions. Hire a person with special training for correcting lead paint problems to remove lead-based paint.

<p>In more complex plans, warm air is allowed to increase and stream out high building openings to the outside (stack impact ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, but care should be required to ensure convenience. In warm or humid environments, keeping thermal comfort entirely via natural ventilation may not be possible. A/c systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also utilize outside air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>
