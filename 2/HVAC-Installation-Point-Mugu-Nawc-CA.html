<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts.

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that interferes with the shipment of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a variety of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, nausea, disorientation, and confusion, to fatigue in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest pain in people with chronic heart disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are in some cases puzzled with the influenza or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, babies, senior people, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing illness can be particularly conscious carbon monoxide gas direct exposures.<p>
