<p>Your concerns or issues about indoor air problems can often be addressed by the federal government companies in your state or city government. Duties for indoor air quality concerns are usually divided amongst many different companies. Calling or writing the agencies responsible for health or air quality assurance is the very best way to start getting info from your state or city government. To acquire state agency contacts, write or call EPA's IAQ Information Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. area.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
