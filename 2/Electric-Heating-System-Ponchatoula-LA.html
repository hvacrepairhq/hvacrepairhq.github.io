<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
