<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, homes and schools matters, especially because we invest most of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the a/c unit is large, it might not attain a low humidity.

A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>I have used around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have signed a yearly maintenance agreement which covers two services every year. Ilan has been wonderful through all these years. Always keeps my system serviced and tuned. Haven't had any problems. Whenever he sees any problems, he notifies me about it and proactively repairs the parts. Really happy with their service. Would recommend them anytime.<p>
