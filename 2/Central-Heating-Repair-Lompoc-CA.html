<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
