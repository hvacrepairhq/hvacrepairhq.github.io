The standards do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services should still be available for your home's systems.

Manufacturers generally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard goes into result.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats up to the ideal temperature.

Only be worried if your home is not heating up. However, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must employ an expert to check and repair the system.<p>
