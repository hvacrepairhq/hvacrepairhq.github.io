There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
