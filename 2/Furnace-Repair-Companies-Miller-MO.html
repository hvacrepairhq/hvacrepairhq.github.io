<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might discover undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.

The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
