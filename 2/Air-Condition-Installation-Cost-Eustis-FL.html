<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.
