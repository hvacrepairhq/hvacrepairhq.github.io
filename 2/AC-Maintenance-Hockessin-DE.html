<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

The radiators might be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
