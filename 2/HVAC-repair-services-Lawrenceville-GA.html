<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
