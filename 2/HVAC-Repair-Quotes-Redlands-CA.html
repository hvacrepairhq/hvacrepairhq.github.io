<h3>Heating And Cooling Near Me in Redlands CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
