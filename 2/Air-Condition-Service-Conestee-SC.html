<p>Certain instant results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently difficult to identify if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is important to focus on the time and place signs take place. If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is far from the area, for instance, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes.
