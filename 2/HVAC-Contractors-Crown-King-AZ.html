<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more efficient. This was initially driven by increasing energy costs, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
