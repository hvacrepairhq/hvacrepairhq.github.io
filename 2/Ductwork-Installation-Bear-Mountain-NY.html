<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
