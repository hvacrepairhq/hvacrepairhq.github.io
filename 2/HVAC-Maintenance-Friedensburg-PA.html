<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was type of unusual being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
