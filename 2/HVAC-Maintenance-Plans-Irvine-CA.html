<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Irvine CA</h3>
<p>Prior to you choose a contractor, think about bids from a minimum of 3 to five respectable contractors. Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no client grievances have been submitted and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is legitimate and active. Compare the different furnace efficiency scores suggested by the private contractors to select the design and system that best suits your energy requires. Bear in mind that energy-star rated equipment will conserve you cash in the end but may involve a greater up-front cost.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their efficiency in time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
