<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in Fort Thomas KY</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
