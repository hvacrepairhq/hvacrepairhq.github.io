<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
