<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide agreements.  The so called respectable companies dupe more people than the fly by night attire.

<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Ravensdale WA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
