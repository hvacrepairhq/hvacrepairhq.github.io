<p>Particular instant effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently hard to figure out if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is important to take note of the time and location the signs happen. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes.
