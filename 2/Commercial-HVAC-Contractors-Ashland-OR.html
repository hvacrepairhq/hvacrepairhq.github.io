<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of changing or exchanging air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
