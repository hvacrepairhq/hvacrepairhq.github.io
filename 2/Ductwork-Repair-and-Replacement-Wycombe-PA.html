If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your monitoring devices to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the proper action to fix the scenario instantly.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure."

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
