<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal components as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple rooms at once, but are not very energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the very same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more cash on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>
<p>Consider possible results of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater.

While a space heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
