<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Livingston NJ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
