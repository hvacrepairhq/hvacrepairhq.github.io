<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated effectiveness benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they do not need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
