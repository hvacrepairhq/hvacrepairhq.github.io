R-600 (isobutane) is currently extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
