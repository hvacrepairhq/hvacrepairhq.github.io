<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Contractor in High Point</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate substantial cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limitations use dose-response information which reveal the health results of repeated exposure to one specific chemical. Similar data is not available for long-lasting, low-level direct exposures to a combination of contaminants as holds true for IAQ problems. Presently, there is inadequate info available to forecast the effects of exposure to a number of possibly damaging agents at the very same time.<p>

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked within, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Professionals suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and normally are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
