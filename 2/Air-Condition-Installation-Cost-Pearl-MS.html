Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
