<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer contracts.. The so called trustworthy companies rip off more people than the fly by night clothing.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
