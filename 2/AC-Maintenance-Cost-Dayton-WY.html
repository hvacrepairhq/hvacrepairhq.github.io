<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in Dayton WY?</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being much more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
