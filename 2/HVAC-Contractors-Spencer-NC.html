<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators utilized flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
