<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Decatur GA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality problems. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic responsibility stipulation" applies. This stipulation, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, specifies that an employer should supply a healthy and safe workplace. Therefore, making sure the air is of great quality is the employer's task.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality issues are not limited to homes. In truth, many office buildings have significant air contamination sources Some of these structures may be improperly ventilated. For example, mechanical ventilation systems might not be created or run to offer adequate quantities of outside air. Finally, people typically have less control over the indoor environment in their workplaces than they perform in their homes. As a result, there has actually been an increase in the incidence of reported illness.<p>
