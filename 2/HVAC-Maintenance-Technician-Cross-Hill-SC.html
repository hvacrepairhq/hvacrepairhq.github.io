<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
