<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
