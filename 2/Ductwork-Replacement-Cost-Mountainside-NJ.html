<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
