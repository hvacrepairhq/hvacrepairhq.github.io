<p>There are 2 main kinds of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating service. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are required to resist existing, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>These people have been terrific. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what work on a house might cost. Recently I required to call on these men two times. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work.
