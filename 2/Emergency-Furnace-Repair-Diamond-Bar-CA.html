<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978.

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
