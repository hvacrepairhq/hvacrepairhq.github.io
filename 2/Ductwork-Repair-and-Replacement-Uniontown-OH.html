<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
