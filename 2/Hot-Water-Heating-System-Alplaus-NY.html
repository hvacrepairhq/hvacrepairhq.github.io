<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Alplaus NY</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning system and heat pump need to be devoid of all blockages and debris.
