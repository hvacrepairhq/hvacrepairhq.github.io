<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
