<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
