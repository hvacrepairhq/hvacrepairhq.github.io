<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power should not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, considering that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
