<h3>AC Service in Wyncote PA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my requirements totally by providing an expert quote with choices, without pressing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the necessary assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
