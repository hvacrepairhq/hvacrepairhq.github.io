Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my buddies.<p>

Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
