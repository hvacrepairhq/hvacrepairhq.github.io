<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
