<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC devices have been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more efficient. This was initially driven by increasing energy costs, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues. In addition, enhancements to the HVAC system efficiency can also help increase resident health and productivity. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually imposed tighter restrictions over the years. There are several methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size.

Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
