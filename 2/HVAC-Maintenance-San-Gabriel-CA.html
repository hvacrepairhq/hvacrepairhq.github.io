<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
