<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
