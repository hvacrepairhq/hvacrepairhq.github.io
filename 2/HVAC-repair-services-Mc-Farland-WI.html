<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and repaired really rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
