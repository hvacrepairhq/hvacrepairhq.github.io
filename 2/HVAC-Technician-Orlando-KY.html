<h3>Picking the Proper Business For Heating and AC Systems at Orlando KY</h3>

<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, decreasing their performance in time. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time fixing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
