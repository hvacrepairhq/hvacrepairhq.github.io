<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
