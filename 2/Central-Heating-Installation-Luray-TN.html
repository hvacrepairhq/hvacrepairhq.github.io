<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Luray TN</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>My eldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues.
