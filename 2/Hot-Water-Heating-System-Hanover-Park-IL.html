<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
