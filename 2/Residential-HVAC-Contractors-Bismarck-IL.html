<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about prospective effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's instructions, especially guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heater effectively adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
