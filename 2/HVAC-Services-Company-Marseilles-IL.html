The effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain because they just partly get rid of the radon decay items and do not diminish the quantity of radon entering the home.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides further details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
