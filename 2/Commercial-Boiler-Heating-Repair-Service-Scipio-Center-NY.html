<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities.

For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
