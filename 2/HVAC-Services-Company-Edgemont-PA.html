This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
