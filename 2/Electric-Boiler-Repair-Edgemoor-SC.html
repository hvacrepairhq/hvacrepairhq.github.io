<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
