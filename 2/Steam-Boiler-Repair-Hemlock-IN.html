<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher salaries for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or just a high level of competitors for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest average earnings for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>Many AC systems feature a number of special functions that can even more enhance efficiency and performance. For instance, homeowners might want to look for one that includes a built-in filter light that will alert you when the air filter requires to be changed. Another popular function to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to reduce energy expenses much more. Of course, more functions imply higher central air conditioning expenses.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to supply enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
