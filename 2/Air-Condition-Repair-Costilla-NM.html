<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a house heating system, you might search for a heatpump more geared towards cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or exceptionally hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
