He also eliminated the leaves that built up inside the interior of the compressor system and advised a service to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I got a comprehensive e-mail report of the evaluation detailing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I highly suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace need to also be examined routinely. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire danger.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
