We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
