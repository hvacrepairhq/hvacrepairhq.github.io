<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can expect a minimum of 1 month throughout which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees.

<p>Buildings are developed or intended to respond actively to a few of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and keep surfaces to boost their look, performance, or longevity. In other cases, such modifications subtly and even dramatically alter structures in ways that may be important to their own stability or their effect on building residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time. We might discover it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, some of the methods used by scientists studying environments, in order to get a boosted understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
