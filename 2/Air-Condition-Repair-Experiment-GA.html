<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
