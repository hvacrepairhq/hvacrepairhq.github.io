If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, considering that it is protected inside. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
