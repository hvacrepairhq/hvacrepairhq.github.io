<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance.

Incorrect modification, typically shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue.

Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your home. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
