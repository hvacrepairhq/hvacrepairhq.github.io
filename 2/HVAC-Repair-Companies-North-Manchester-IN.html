<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install evaluation outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality.

Anticipate to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
