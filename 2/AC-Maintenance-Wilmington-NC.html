<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
