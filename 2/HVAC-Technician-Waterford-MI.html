<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Waterford MI</h3>
<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to order it. My better half said that she had seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have met in a long time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
