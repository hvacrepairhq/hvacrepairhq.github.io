<h3>Furnace Replacement in Tujunga California</h3>
<p>New air conditioners typically vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER ranking means higher energy performance and possibly lower energy costs. An excellent SEER rating for you depends on your house size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally allowed SEER ranking is going to be far more energy effective than your current, old air conditioner. It's not always about selecting the design with the greatest SEER ranking, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the compressor, condenser, and evaporator are all located in one cabinet, which typically is put on a roofing or on a concrete slab next to your house's structure.

Packaged air conditioning system often include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This mix of a/c unit and central heater removes the need for a separate furnace inside.<p>
<p>Similar to many house enhancement jobs, the cost of a complete central heater can differ commonly based upon the size of the home. A lot of heating systems will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, homeowner should consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
