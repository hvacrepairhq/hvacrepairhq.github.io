<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Regardless of the type of electric glowing flooring heating system, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or altered. Any interference or interruption in the flow of electrical power makes the system unusable. This is among the disadvantages to setting up an electric convected heat system. Nevertheless, assuming they are set up properly and appropriately taken care of, the likelihood of them having issues is small.<p>
