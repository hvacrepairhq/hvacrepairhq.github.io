<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air toxin could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, family pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>

If you already have a home heater, you may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness.
