<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house.

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of individuals.<p>
