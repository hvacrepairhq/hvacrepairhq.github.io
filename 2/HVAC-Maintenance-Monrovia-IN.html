<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heat pump While space a/c supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
