<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season.

Plus, there's even an added cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
