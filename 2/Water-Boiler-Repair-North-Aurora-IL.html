<h3>Heating System Installation in North Aurora IL</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
