<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
