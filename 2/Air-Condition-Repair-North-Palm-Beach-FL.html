<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in North Palm Beach Florida</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
