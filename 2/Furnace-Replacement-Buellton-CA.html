<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, considering current modifications in refrigerants and cooling designs, it might be smarter to replace the entire system.<p>
