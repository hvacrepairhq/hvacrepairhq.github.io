<p>Often, heating repairs are merely not possible. Maybe your furnace is too old, your heatpump is too damaged, or your boiler just can't be repaired.

<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a qualified representative from an organisation or retailer to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the a/c system. A voided service warranty will not do you any good should the system stop working or malfunction.
