<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
