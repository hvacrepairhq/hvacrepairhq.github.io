<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
