<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
