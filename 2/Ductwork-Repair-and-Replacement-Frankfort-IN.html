<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad.

A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
