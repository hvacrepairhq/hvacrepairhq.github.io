<p>A customized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the very same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, considering that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
