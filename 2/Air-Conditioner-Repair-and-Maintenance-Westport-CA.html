When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up.

In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
