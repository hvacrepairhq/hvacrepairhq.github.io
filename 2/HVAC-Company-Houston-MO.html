<p>Let's start by outlining the planning that requires to happen before you actually buy a furnace. Picking a furnace for your house isn't as simple as selecting one off a showroom floor. Not all furnaces are good for all houses, and there are a couple of aspects that absolutely require to be thought about before selecting one. First, you'll require one that is properly sized for your home. A furnace that is too big will put out excessive heat for your system to deal with, and will cause problems like short-cycling that can reduce its life. A furnace that is too little, on the other hand, will not be able to offer sufficient heat to keep your house comfy.<p>

Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
