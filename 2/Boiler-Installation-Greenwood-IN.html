<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
