<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
