When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost evaluation bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the kind of system you choose for your home.

<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the exact same period. Basically, SEER provides more information based on how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The higher the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Lockwood CA</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
