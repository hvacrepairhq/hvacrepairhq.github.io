<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing.

<p>A specific ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. A basic air conditioning unit transfers heat out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
