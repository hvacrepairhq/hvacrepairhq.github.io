As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
