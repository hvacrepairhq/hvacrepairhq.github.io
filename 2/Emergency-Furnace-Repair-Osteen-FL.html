<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Osteen FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
