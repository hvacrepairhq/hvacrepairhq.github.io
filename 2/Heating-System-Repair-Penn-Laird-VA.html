<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
