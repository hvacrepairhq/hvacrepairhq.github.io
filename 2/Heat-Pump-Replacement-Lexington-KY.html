These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
