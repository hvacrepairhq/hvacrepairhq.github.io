<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
