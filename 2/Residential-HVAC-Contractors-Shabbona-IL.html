<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
