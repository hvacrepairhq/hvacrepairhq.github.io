<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
