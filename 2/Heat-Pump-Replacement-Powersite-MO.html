<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer agreements.  The so called respectable companies swindle more people than the fly by night outfits. Since I attempted to work for them, I understand. I quit because 90% of them are crooks. They stroll in with or without a contract and begin selling you things you don't require. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as a consultant to verify the so called treatments and issues. 9 out of 10, I check are entirely wrong.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company needs to examine measurements of air, temperature and humidity flow.
