<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is simply as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often develop in ductwork, restricting airflow. Because ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear extremely difficult at first, needing specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not have to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
