<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
