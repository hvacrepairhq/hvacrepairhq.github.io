<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>If you work in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you may unconsciously bring lead into your house on your clothes or hands. You may also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil very near to houses may be contaminated from lead paint on the outside of the structure. Soil by highways and roadways may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet prior to getting in the house. Change your clothing before you go home and wash these clothing separately if you work with lead in your task or a pastime. Motivate your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which sticks to toys and fingers. Try to keep your children from consuming dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come inside.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home.

The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.
