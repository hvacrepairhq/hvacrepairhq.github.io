<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Ridgeland SC</h3>
<p>When constructing your new home a well-functioning Heating and Cooling system is crucial, as well as the air quality you breathe within. We have the experience and resources necessary to assist from the preparation stages through to the final installation. We utilize the latest software to assist design your ductwork system and use the highest quality products in the building and construction and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation likewise depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heat pumps normally require excavation to set up, which adds a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is utilized to transport the heat to the rooms. Most modern-day hot water boiler heating unit have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
