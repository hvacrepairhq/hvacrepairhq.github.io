<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Agoura Hills CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
