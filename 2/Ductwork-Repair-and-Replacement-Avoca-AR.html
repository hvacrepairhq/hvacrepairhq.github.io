<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
