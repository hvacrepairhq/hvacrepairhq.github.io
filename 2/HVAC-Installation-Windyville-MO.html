<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
