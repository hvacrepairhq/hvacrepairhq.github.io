<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to maintain and understand.<p>
