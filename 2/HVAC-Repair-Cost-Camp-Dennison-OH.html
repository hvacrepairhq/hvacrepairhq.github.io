<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best choice for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
