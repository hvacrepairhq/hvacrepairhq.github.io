<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Kleinfeltersville Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold love moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% assists keep them and other irritants under control.

An a/c also minimizes indoor pollen count - another plus for allergic reaction -sufferers.<p>
