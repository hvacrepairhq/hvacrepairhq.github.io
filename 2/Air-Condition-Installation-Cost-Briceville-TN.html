<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
