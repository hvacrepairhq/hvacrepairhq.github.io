<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
