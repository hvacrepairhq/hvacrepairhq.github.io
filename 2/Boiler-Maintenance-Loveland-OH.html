<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
