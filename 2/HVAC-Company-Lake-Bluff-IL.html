<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide guidance to replace instead of repair a heating system. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often important to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping track of data is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data might recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of information may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
