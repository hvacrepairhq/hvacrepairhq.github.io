<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water.

A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis.
