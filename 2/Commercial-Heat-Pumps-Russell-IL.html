<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
