<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
