<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
