<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
