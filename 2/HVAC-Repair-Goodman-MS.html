This is typically used in a 2nd or third-floor  location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
