<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
