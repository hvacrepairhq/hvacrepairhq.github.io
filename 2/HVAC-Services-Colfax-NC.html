<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
