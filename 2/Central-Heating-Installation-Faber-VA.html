<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne item of a biological pollutant. Biological contaminants in the home may consist of mold, bacteria, infections, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols launched into the air can be distributed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger contagious illness such as Legionnaires' illness.

Signs brought on by biological toxins consist of sneezing, eye irritation, coughing, lightheadedness, and breathing infections.<p>

<p>Our indoor air quality specialists can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To decrease toxins, we advise setting up innovative air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are designed to eliminate the tiniest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems also help control bacteria and organic smells. The majority of store-bought filters can not remove these smallest of irritants and don't get rid of gases and germs.<p>
<p>Since they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
