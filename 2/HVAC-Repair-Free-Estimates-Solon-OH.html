<p>While toxins commonly found in indoor air are responsible for lots of hazardous impacts, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are needed to produce specific health problems. Individuals likewise respond very differently to direct exposure to indoor air toxins.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location.
