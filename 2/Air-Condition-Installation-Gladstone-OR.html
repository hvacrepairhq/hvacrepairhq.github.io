<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.
