The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils.

(He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
