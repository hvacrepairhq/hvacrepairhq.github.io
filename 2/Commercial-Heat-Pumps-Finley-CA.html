<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
