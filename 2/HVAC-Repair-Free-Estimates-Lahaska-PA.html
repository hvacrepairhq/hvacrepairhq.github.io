<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
