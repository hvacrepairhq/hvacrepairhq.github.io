One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to resist current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
