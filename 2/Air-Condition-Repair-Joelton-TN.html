<h3>Facts All Joelton TN Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Convected heat systems are increasingly popular, specifically in the past quarter-century as innovation has actually advanced, and the systems have proven themselves in reliability and economy. Unlike convection heating, convected heat systems have no air and no ductwork blood circulation. Radiant systems depend upon heat transfer by the infrared clinical principle utilized by the sun called line of sight." These undetectable electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a home, the warmer things naturally heat the cooler ones till a balance is attained.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
