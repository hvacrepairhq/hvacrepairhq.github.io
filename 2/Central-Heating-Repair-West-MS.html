Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices maker's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.. a very advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
