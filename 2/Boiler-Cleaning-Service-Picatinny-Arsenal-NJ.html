<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Picatinny Arsenal NJ</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c".

When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
