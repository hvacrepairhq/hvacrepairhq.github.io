<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats.
