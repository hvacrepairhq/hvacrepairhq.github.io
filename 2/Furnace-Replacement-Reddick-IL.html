<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
