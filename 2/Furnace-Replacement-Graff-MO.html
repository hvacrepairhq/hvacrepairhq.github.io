<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
