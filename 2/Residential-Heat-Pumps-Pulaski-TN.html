<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside may trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
