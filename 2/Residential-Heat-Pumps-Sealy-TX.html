<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally higher than many heatpump choices, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the design you buy. Among the main advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating options. This means it can warm up your house to the desired temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, think about possible effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's instructions, particularly instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater appropriately adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the remainder of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
