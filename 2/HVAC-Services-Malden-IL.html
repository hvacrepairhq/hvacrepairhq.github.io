<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Malden IL?</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home construction is to reduce air leak through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
