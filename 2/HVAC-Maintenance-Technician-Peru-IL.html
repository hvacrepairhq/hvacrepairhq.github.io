<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
