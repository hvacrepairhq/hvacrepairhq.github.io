<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
