<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, considering that it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but many use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better option. If the existing system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality problem is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more intricate problems-- identified by regularly undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the problem you're experiencing, one of the three methods listed below might be appropriate.<p>
