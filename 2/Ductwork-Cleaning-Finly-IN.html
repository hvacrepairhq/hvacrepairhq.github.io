There have been awkward noises. I got it fixed and checked. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. In general, it has actually been an excellent experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. But then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
