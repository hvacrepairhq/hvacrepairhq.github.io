<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
