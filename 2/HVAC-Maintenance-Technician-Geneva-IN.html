<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can generally be carried out in just a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
