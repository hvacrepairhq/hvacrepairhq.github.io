<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, rather than outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It may likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual areas.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate environment, where the temperature level doesn't get too low or too high.
