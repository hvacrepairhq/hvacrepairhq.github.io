<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
