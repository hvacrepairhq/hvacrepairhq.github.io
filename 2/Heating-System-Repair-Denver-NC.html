<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
