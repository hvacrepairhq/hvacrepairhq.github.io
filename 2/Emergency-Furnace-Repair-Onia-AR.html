<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
