<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops ought to be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can likewise develop particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
