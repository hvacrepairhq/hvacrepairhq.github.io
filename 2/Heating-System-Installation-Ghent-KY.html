<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
