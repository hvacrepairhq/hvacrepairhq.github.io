<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater.
