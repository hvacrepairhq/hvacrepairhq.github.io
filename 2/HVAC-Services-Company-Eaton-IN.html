<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
