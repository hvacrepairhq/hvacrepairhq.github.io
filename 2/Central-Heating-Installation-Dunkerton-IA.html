<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the system. Loose, missing or defective wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves examining the recommended connections as well as temperature level and pressure determines. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and secure.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They include hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, kids, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults considering that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
