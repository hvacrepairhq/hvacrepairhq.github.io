<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good location to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!

Managers with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one component (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>

This indicates it can warm up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
