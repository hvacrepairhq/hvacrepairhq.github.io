<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
