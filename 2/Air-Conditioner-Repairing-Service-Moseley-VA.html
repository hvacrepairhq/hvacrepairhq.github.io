<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
