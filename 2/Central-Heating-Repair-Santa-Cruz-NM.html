<p>We take a look at clues before we offer advice to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical power and gas increasing, it is very important to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy savings.

Rather, the combustion is optimized by measuring the exhaust gasses and making scientific changes. This alone might pay for the entire maintenance go to at today's price of gas.<p>
