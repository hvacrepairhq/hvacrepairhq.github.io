<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may become blocked, lowering air circulation circulation, quality, and volume.
