<p>Make sure there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else restricting the flow of air. Not only will blocked vents and signs up affect your convenience, they can also cause duct leakages due to excessive atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT an excellent idea. You won't save any additional money and will wind up triggering more issues for your heating unit.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
