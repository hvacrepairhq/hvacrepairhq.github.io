<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
