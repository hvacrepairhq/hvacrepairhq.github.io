<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
