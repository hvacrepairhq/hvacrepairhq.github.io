<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a service was for monetary liberty.

During high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
