<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
