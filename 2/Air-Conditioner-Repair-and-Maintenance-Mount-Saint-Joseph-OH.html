<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged.
