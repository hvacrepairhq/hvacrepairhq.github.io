<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Riverdale NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
