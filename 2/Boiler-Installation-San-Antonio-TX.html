<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at San Antonio TX</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
