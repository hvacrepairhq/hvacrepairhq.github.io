<p>We look at ideas before we offer advice to change instead of repair a heating unit. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>

He clearly and completely explained all problems and repairs in a way that made me positive in his ability to resolve my repair issues. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He also responded to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to a problem that couldn't be resolved on the very first see due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
