<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Lowell MI</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run constantly is because something is filthy or clogged up Before trying to repair any issue, take time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". Examine the furnace blower for blocking and clean it if the air filter is good to go. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, contact a skilled technician.<p>
