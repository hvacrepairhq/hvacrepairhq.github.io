<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality problems. In the lack of such legislation, the "general task stipulation" applies. This stipulation, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer should provide a safe and healthy  office. Hence, ensuring the air is of excellent quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they simply didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
