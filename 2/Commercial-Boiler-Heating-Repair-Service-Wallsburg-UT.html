Many typical building products utilized before 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials.

A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.<p>
