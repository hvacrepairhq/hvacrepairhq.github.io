<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system. Loose, defective or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace involves inspecting the advised connections in addition to temperature level and pressure evaluates. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and protected.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
