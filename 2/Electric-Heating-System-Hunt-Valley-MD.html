<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
