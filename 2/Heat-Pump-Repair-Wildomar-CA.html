<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use.

Incorrectly located outdoor air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological impurities that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
