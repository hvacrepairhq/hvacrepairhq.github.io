<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
