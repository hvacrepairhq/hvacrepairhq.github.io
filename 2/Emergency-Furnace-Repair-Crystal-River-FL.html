<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may observe moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.
