No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, appropriate air flow (ventilation), proper purification, and humidity manage all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is operating securely and not adding to or triggering an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
