<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Elizabethtown IN</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
