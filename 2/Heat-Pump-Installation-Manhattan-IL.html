<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps should likewise be taken to lessen pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners need to be alert to the introduction of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures must not be undertaken till these issues have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
<p>If your single stage a/c unit isn't old enough to validate replacement, think about a whole home dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and enabling higher convenience at higher temperatures.<p>
<p>Humid and damp conditions reproduce mold and mildew that can activate breathing issues like allergic reactions and asthma. Depending on your location, the hot summer months can bring about especially humid conditions. Minimize the quantity of moisture in the air and suppress the growth of irritating molds with a couple of well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a range of humidifier options that will help preserve consistent humidity levels and create comfy living conditions in your home.<p>
