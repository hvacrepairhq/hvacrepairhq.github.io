<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
