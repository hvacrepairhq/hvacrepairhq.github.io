<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Redkey IN - The Benefits</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater because the service technicians thought they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
