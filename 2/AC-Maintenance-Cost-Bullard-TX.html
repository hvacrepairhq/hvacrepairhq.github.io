<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent.

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
