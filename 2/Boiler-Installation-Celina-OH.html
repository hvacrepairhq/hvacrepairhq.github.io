<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
