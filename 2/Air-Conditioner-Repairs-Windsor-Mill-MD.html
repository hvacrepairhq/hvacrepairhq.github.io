<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside.
