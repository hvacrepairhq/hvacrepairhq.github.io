<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Creston CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
