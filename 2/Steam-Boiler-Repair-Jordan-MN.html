<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers during summer seasons. The very best thing to do is making sure that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned up thoroughly prior to chillier seasons start. Constantly make certain that the furnace is cleaned up annually to avoid soot and condensation which triggers burners to stop working effectively. If your furnace remains in an extremely poor condition, possibly it is time to start considering buying a brand-new one.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
