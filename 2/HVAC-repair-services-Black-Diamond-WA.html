<p>In houses, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items produced indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them till they have actually been appropriately dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems.
