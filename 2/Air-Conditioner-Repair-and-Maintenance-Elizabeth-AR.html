<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
