<p>Measurement treatments are being established and shown to evaluate building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These treatments range from sophisticated tracer gas techniques utilized primarily in building research efforts to less involved treatments that can be employed by developing operators.

<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside.

Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
