<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

For instance, mechanical ventilation systems may not be created or run to offer sufficient amounts of outside air.
