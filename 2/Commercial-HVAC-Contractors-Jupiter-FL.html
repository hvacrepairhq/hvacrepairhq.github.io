<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Jupiter FL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
