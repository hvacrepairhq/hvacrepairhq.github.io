<p>The most common type of house heating system in the U.S. burns gas or lp to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly option, but more recent systems can be very energy effective.

<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in location. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated usage of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early deterioration, leading to fractures and holes. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.. a really advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
