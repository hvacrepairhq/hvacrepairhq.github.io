<p>There are two primary forms of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating service. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to resist existing, which then creates heat.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
