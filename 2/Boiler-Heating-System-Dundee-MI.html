<p>Oil heating systems are normally not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not achieve an efficiency greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Due to the fact that a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
