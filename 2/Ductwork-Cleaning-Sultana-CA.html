<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
