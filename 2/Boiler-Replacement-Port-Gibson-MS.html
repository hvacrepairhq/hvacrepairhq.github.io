<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin.

Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins.
