<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
