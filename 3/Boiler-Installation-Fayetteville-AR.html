<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
