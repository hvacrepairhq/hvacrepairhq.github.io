<p>Use experts and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated experts perform better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place.

For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, leading to holes and cracks. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  an extremely beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
