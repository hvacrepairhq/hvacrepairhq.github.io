<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Dayton Virginia</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded indoors. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up.
