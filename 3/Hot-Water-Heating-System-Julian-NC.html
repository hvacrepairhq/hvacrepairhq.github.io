<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Julian NC</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
