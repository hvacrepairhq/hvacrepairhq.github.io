<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or stinky air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To discover odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality problem is produced just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complex issues-- determined by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 techniques listed below may be suitable.<p>
