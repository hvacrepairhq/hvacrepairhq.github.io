<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and last floor surface. This is usually utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  location and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
