<p>To establish a safe assessment or consultation with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your location in an online search. Message or call specialists to ask whether they can perform a consultation over the phone or even over a video call. By doing this, they can examine the problem without increasing the threat of infection transmission by visiting your home.<p>

If the system is new and still under a manufacturer's warranty, the cost may not be rewarding. Any major repairs should be covered under the manufacturer's warranty.
