<p>Keep in mind that the SEER rating is computed utilizing the same set of temperatures throughout the board. The average summer temperature level to reach the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to reach the right SEER rating for your location, deduct 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
