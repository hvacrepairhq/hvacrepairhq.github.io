<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system.
