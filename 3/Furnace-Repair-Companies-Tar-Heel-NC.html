<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, a lot of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
