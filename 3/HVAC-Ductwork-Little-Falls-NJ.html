<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. A/c is something that most Seattleites will just utilize sparingly, however since heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds! Not just are heatpump hassle-free, they are incredibly energy effective, too. If a heat pump remains in your future, the best time to install a/c in your house may extremely well be when your heater breaks down.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heating system, you might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and performance.
