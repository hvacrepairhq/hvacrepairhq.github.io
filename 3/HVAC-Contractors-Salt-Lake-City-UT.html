<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When installing the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>A geothermal heating system is more trusted than options, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power.
