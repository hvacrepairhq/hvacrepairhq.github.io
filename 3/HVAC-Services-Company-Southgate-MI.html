<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
