Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
