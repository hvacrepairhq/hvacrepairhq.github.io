<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and offices matters, especially since we spend the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely humid environments or in cases where the a/c is large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
