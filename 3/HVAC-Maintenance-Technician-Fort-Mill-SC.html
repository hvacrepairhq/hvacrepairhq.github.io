<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>

Convected heat offers heat from the floor up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
