<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very thorough in explaining what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn supplied excellent customer support at the end of the visit by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have actually done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement.
