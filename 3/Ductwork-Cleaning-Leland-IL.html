<p>A specialized a/c unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air path. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>

<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>Over the past few years, there has actually been some publicity recommending that houseplants have been shown to decrease levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is presently no proof, nevertheless, that an affordable number of houseplants eliminate considerable quantities of pollutants in homes and workplaces.
