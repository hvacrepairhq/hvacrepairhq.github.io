<p>Think about a whole house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old enough to justify replacement.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
