<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
