Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are generally used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher airflow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air purification innovations are becoming more common as offered options in commercial and residential HVAC product packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been extensive, as clients remain mainly oblivious to the results of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
