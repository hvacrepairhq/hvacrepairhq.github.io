While installing a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
