<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes.
