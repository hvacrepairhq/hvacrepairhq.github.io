<p>Information supplied in this safety guide is based upon present clinical and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The standards do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services must still be available for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Manufacturers typically continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard enters into effect.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
