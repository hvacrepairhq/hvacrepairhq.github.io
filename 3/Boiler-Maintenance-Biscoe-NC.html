<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
