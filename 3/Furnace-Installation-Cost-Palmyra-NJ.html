<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Occupants of homes with bad indoor air quality might suffer symptoms such as headache, eye irritation, fatigue, dry throat, sinus queasiness, congestion, and dizziness. Diagnosing sick building syndrome is tough since many diseases can trigger these symptoms. Extremely high levels of some pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, can cause more serious illness, including death.<p>
