<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
