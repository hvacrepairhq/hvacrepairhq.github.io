<p>We needed two gos to - Jake came out first and was very educated and pleasant and courteous. Grant came out a couple days later on and was likewise experienced and nice to speak with.

<p>Through typical usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit may end up being very dirty. These elements of the devices are crucial for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans up all components, and examines connections to ensure they are secure. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for proper function and general condition. This is an excellent chance to identify parts that are used or defective. When the problem is fairly small, replacing them to repair the air conditioning might be a lot less costly.<p>

Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
