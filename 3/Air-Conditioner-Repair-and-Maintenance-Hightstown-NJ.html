My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I have actually ended up being fairly proficient at looking into items on line prior to buying them. However I don't discover that there is a central place for browsing information about the "real" value of house HVAC systems or perhaps I need to state a truthful assessment of these items. Because I reside in FL it is crucial to have a good AC unit in your house because they are truly taxed in the summer season.<p>
