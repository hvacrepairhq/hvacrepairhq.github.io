<p>Filters can get dirty easily, particularly if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you expect it to if they're not cleaned up and replaced routinely.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
