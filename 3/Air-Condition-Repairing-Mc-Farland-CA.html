<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
