<p>A health questionnaire must be developed and distributed to all worried workers. Such a tool must identify the number of individuals affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; identify where they lie within the workplace; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of particular health symptoms or health problems; determine all machines run in the workplace; indicate the kind of outside air pollution; and determine potential sources of task stress.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
