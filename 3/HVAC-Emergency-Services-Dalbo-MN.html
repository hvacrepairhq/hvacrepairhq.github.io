Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
