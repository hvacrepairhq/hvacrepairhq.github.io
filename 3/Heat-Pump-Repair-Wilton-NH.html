This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
