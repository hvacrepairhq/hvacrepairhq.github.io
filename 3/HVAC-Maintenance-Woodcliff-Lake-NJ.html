<h3>Radiant Heating System in Woodcliff Lake New Jersey</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
