The product was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with concerns.
