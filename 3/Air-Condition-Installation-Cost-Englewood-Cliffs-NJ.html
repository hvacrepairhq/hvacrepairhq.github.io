<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
