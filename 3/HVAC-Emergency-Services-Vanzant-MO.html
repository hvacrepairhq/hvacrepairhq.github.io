<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the possibilities are good that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>Many HVAC company owner do not understand they require various pricing plans for various services that their company provides.
