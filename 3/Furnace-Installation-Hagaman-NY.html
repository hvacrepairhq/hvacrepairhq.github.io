<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Hagaman NY?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
