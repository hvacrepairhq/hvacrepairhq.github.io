<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats to the right temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. If your house is not heating up, just be concerned.

<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Las Vegas NV</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
