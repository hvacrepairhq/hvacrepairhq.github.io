<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes set up under the flooring or right within the flooring surface area itself.

Obstructions can obstruct the circulation of condensed water and trigger moisture build-up within the system. Excess wetness can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, irregular temperature level policy, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to ensure all excess moisture streams far from the system.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
