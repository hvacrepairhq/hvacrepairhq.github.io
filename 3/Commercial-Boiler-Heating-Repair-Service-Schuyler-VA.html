Moreover, cooling contractors might charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra materials and devices.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
