<p>The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>
