<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
