Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.
