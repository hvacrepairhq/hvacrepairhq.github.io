These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation.

The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation.
