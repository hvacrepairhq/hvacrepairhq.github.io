<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
