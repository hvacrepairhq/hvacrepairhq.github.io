<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
