<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
