<p>All heater have some level of air filtering. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance.

<p>Utilize professionals and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated specialists carry out much better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
