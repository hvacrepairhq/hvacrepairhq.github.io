<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
