Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.

<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other pollutants that can not just dirty up the air, but result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (volatile organic substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do determine a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating unit and pick to install it in your house, you could be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs. (And these costs can be substantial. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, property owners can expect to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.) Consult the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are refunds, loans or tax reductions available for the installation of a more efficient in-floor heating system where you live.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
