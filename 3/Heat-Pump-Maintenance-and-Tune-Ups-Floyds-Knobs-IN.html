<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Also they identified the concern and repaired very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
