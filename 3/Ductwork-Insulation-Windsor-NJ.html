<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, schools and houses matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in very damp environments or in cases where the a/c is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
