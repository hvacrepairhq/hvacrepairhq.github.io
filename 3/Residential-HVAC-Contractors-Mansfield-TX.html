For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, visit Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
