<p>Biological impurities: the biological pollutants can consist of bacteria, viruses, fungi (mold), allergen allergen, animal dander, insect bio fragments, fiberglass and fibers, pollen, cockroach irritant, etc. and may arise from inadequate maintenance and house cleaning, water spills, inadequate humidity control, condensation, or may be brought into the structure by occupants, infiltration, or ventilation air.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
