<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
