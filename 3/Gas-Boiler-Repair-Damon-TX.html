<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
