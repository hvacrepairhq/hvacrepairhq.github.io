<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping device to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat moved heat to other articles in the spaces, including the human occupants.<p>

Plus, there's even an added cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
