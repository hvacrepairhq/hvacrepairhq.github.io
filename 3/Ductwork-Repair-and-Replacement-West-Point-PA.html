<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
