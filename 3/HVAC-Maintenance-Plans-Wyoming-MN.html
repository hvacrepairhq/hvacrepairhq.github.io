<p>A health questionnaire must be established and distributed to all worried employees. Such a tool should determine the variety of people impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; determine where they are located within the workplace; indicate when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of specific health signs or illnesses; determine all devices run in the office; suggest the type of outdoors air contamination; and determine potential sources of task stress.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. When the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your house lies, the local area's environment can change dramatically.
