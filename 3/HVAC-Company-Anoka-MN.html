<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
