Throughout high use months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
