<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes filthy and old.

Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
