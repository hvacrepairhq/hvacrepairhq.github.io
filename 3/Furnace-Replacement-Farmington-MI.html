<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the exact same duration. Essentially, SEER provides more data based on how the EER performs in different temperatures. The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
