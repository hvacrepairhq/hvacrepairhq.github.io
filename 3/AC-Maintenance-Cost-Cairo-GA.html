<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
