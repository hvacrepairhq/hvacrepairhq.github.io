<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large seller who asked not to be called since he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save money on costs (particularly during the night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the shops change outside of an appropriate variety that could prevent clients from shopping at the shop.<p>

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
