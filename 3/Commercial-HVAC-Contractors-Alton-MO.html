<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not provide contracts.  The so called reputable companies dupe more people than the fly by night attire.

<p>There is a needed balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE ratings often include higher cost.

Water can likewise puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
