<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may pick to replace the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor unit. However, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and a/c styles, it might be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
