He knew just what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
