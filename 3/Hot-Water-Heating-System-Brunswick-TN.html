<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably simple to determine surrogate for indoor toxins discharged by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside may trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Invest in education and training: HVAC is not "rule of thumb" work, and no two homes are the same. When service technicians are effectively trained, they pick and install efficient, safe equipment. They know what it indicates to provide first-class craftsmanship, and they get less callbacks from disappointed customers. Creators and supervisors should also stay abreast of developing innovations and industry finest practices.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years ago and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
