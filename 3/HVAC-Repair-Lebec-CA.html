<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
