<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best choice for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
