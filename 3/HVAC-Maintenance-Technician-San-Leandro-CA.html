<h2>How To Hire HVAC Company in San Leandro</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits annually, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and generally some other perks. Some companies provide priority consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>
