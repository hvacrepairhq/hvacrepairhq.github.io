<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Numerous common structure materials utilized before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation.

A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is typically suggested instead.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being common functions of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green building motion. Green projects accounted for 20 percent of all freshly constructed homes in the U.S. last year.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would use.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a few years back.<p>
