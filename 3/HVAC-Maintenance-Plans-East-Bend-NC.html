<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be effectively determined or corrected without a comprehensive building investigation.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
