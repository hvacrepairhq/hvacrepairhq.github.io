<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house might not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To identify odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two must not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for generating power in the form of electrical power. The two operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>
