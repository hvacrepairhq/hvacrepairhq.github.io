<p>Among the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly costly to install, particularly in an older home. Depending on the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and trigger issues if you're extremely allergic to dust. Additionally, particular fuels and equipment might require special permits, and there is limited flexibility in case of altered heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office complex such as health centers and skyscrapers, automobiles such as automobiles, trains, ships, submarines and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
