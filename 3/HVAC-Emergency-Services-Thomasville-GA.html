Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
