<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
