<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Care! Environment Pro is trustworthy and genuinely cared about us and our situation. We got back one evening to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might try to find and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated home once again. What's most incredible was that this all taken place during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right prior to a holiday, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
