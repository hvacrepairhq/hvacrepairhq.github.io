<p>While toxin levels from specific sources might not position a substantial health threat by themselves, the majority of homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a major threat from the cumulative results of these sources. Thankfully, there are actions that most people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to avoid new problems from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to assist you choose whether to do something about it that can minimize the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
<p>Installing air conditioning costs between $3,350 and $5,912 with most house owners reporting spending $4,631 typically. This price is typical of setting up a brand-new AC system to your forced air furnace. Other options include single window systems or portable systems for $234 to $700 or ductless mini splits for $660 to $4,500. Your overall cost depends upon the type and size of a/c system you require.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
