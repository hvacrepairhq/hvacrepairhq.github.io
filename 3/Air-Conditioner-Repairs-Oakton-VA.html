There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it checked and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has actually been a great experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the beginning. But then realized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was known how hazardous lead might be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the skills or tools essential to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
