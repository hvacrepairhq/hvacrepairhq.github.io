<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
