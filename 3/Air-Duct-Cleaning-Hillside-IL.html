<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Repair in Hillside IL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
