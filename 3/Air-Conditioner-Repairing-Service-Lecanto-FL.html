<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often important to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can often be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping track of information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should request that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information may recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
