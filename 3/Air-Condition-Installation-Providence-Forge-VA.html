Insulation may be a more effective service to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
