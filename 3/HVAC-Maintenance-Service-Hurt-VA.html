<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use.

If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
