Also they diagnosed the concern and fixed very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel need to be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
