Some sources, such as constructing materials, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release toxins more or less continually. Other sources, related to activities like smoking, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies release pollutants periodically. Malfunctioning or unvented home appliances or poorly used products can release higher and often dangerous levels of contaminants inside.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted separately.
