<p>While pollutants frequently found in indoor air are responsible for lots of hazardous results, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are necessary to produce particular illness. People likewise react extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further research study is needed to much better understand which health impacts happen after direct exposure to the typical contaminant concentrations found in homes and which take place from the greater concentrations that take place for brief time periods.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
