<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Ponder TX</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We picked getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up because the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness gradually. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
