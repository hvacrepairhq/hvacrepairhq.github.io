Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, figuring out the right size of unit for your home also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins which abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
