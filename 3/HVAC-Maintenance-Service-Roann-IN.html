<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Roann IN</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely happy that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the ac system prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
