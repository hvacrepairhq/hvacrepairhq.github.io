Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
