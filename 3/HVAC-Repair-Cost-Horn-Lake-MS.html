<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have been correctly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
