In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the very same time, since the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, considering that it considers not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
