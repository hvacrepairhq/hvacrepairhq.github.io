<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
