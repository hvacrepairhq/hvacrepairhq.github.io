<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
