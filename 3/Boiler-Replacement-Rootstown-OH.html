<p>In general, ductless AC units are more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient than traditional HVACs. This is since you can shut off individual rooms when you're not occupying them.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
