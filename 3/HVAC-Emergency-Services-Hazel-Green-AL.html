<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
