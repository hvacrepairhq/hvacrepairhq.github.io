The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
