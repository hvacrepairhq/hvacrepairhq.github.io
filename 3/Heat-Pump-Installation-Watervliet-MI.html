<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>For example, impurities may collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outside pollutant, it might function as a pathway to carry the pollutants inside.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
