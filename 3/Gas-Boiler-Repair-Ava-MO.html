In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler normally take place when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is incorrectly lined up or worn and needs replacement. Follow the guidelines above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
