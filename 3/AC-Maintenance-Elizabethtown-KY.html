<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER).

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
