If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. Just like determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, determining the right size of system for your house likewise depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems at Mendenhall MS</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants discharged by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside your home might cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
