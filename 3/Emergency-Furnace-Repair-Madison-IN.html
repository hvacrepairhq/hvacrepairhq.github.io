Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
