<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
