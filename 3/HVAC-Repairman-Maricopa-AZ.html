<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
