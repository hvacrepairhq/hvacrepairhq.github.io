<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My better half stated that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have met in a long time.
