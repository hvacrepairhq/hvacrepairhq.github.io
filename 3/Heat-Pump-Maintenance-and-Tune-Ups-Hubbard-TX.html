<h3>Ductwork Installation in Hubbard TX</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
