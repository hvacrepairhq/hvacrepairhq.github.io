<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Through typical use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit might become very filthy. These aspects of the equipment are essential for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans up all components, and checks connections to guarantee they are secure. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for proper function and total condition. This is an excellent opportunity to recognize parts that are used or faulty. When the issue is reasonably small, changing them to fix the air conditioning may be a lot less expensive.<p>
<p>Consider a whole house dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old sufficient to justify replacement.
