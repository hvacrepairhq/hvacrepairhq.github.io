<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one action stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated use of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  a very useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
