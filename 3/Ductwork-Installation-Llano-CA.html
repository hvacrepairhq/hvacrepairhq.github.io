<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Llano CA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in house building and construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floors, and roofs. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>
