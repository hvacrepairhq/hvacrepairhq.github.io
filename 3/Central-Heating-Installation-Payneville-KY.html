<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant.

There are many ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and many other products.<p>
