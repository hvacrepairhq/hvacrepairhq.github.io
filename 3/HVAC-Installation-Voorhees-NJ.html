<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Your Review This is my third time utilizing All the time. Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is competent with these gadgets). I have absolutely nothing however terrific things to say - he has taken excellent care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick action - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Just a professional can accurately identify why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something seems odd or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call an expert. Likewise, if the procedure does not work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you discover you need to do it frequently, it's most likely time for a professional opinion.<p>
