<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Lynnwood WA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>The sooner you connect with Aire Serv, the earlier we can solve your central heat and cooling concerns. In addition to residential and commercial cooling and heating services, our local teams use other services, including carbon monoxide and smoke detector installation, thermostat installation, and indoor air quality services such as air filtration services and installation of dehumidifiers and humidifiers.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and efficiency if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new homes are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. A few of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (likewise referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers). For additional information about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Energy Query and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
