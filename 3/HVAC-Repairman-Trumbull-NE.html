<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Trumbull NE</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
