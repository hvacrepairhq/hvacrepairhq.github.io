<p>Current Review: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements entirely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the present one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
