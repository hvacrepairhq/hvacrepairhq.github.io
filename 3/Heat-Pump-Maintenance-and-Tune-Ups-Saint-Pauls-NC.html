<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Saint Pauls NC</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Because an a/c unit moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
