<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
