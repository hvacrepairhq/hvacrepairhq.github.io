What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
