<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo searches for more than simply extra revenue or scale when it makes acquisitions - it tries to find companies that can broaden Pueblo's client base or supply a brand-new line of services. For example, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo performed minimal plumbing work for select customers. With this acquisition, Pueblo expanded its abilities, enabling an enhanced value proposition for a wider set of clients.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
