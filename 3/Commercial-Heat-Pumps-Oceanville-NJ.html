<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators employed combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
