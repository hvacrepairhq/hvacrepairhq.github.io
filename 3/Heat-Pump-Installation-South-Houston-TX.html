<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your South Houston TX Home</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to buy it. My other half said that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total.
