<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives normally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial cost of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout new construction (homes typically utilize between one and 5 heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
