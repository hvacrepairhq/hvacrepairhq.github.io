<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system.

Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not basic, because it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
