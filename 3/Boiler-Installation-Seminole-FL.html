<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>5. Smell good naturally.

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour.

I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
