<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Since an ac system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Heat pumps are a dream become a reality for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that the majority of Seattleites will just utilize moderately, but because heat pumps can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract attempts to upsell you each time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was six months before the present one expired. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
