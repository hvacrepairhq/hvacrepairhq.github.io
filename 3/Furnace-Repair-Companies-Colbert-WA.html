<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same method as an automobile radiator or typical household air conditioning system does.

If you buy a brand-new gas stove or variety, consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
