<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially pricey to set up, specifically in an older home.

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when buying an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window.
