<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>HVAC Installation in North Billerica MA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater air flow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and brand-new air purification technologies are becoming more typical as offered options in commercial and residential HVAC product bundles. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been widespread, as consumers stay mainly unconcerned to the results of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm at some time. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, and even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who explained our options did an excellent job in making sure we understood the pros and cons of each choice. The professionals who set up the brand-new system were expert and fast, while taking time to make certain we comprehended how the new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
