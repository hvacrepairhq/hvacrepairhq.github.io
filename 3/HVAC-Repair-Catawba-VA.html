<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
