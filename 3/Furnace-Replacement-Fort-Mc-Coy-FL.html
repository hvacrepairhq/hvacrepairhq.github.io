<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits utilize dose-response data which reveal the health impacts of repetitive direct exposure to one particular chemical. Similar data is not offered for long-lasting, low-level direct exposures to a combination of impurities as is the case for IAQ problems.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
