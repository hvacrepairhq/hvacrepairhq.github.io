<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Improper change, frequently indicated by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you purchase a brand-new gas stove or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never utilize a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
