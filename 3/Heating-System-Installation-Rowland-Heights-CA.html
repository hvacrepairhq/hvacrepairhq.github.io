<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme.

Children may have higher exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
