<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Santaquin UT</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most economical if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
