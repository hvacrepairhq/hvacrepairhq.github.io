<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heater can also be connected to a device known as a geothermal desuperheater.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
