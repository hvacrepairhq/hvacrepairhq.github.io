<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Power resources: Verify your access to electrical resources. Numerous older houses have limited capability to include significant home appliances at the level of a central air conditioner.

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
