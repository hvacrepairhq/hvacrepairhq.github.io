<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that perfect temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service strategy which generally includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
