<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I have been using them for years for my services, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is truthful, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find an honest AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
