<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
