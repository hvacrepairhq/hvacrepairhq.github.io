The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most economical if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Use professionals and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated professionals carry out much better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. An ethical company doesn't exploit cheap labor chances even if they're cheap. Economical craftsmanship is generally substandard craftsmanship, and it never assists a company develop long-lasting relationships with customers.<p>
