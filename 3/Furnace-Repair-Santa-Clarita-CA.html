<p>Homeowners might also assume that because a radiant floor heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a home enhancement, its installation will instantly raise their home's value. No evidence exists recommending that in-floor heating either favorably or adversely impacts home values.

<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
