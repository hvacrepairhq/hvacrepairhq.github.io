<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
