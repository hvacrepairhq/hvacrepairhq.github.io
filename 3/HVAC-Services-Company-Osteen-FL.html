<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They consist of delays in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, fetuses, and children are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
