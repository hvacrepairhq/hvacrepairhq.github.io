<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>New air conditioning unit normally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER ranking implies higher energy performance and possibly lower energy costs.
