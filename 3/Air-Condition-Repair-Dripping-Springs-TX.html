<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
