I don't know sufficient about the technology to understand if that is even possible.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer should inspect measurements of temperature, humidity and air circulation. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make certain it is working according to specs for constructing use and tenancy) ought to be performed. A building walk-through to look for odors and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or pest droppings might be handy. Leaks need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning systems, on roofings and in boiler pans can become polluted with fungi or bacteria and need to be eliminated, also. In some circumstances, specific testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of building occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos requires to be checked every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>A/c unit can develop a great deal of water because they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler.
