<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system.

Geothermal heat pumps typically need excavation to set up, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
