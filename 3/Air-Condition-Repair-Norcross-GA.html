<h3>Furnace Repair in Norcross Georgia</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater does not create its power by burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, or coal. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth. Moreover, a geothermal heating and cooling system uses significantly less electrical power compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an appealing option to cut your carbon footprint, providing a positive impact on the environment.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they identified the concern and repaired very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
