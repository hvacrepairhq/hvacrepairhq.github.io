<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
