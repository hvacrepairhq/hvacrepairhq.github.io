<h3>HVAC Technician in Saint Clair PA</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Company Description: Trust is very important-- especially when you're working with someone to come into your house to repair or install costly heating and cooling devices. People all over Washington, consisting of King, Snohomish, Skagit, Whatcom and Island Counties, have offered us their trust for the previous 30 years since we have actually devoted ourselves to supplying quality service and the absolute best value on every check out we make. And we guarantee the exact same quality for you and your family.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioner isn't old adequate to justify replacement, think about a whole house dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can take pleasure in a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and enabling higher convenience at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
