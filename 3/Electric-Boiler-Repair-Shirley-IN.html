<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, a professional service individual ought to be required nearly any maintenance besides regular cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners need to be expertly checked and adjusted prior to the start of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak efficiency.<p>
