<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes.
