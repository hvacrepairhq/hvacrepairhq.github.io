<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and treat-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
