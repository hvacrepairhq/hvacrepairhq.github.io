<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
