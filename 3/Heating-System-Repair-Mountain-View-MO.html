<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Mountain View MO</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
