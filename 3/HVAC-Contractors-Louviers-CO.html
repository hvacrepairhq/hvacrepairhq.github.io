<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
