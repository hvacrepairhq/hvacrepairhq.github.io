<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
