The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 must be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
