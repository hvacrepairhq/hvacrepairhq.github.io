A lot of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
