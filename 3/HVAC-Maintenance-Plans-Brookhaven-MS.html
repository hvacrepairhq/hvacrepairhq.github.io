<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
