<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size.

On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the house on hot days.
