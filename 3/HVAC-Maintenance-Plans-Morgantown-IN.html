<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>Chemical pollutants: Volatile natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; wall, furnishings and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent need to request that the company have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this data might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
