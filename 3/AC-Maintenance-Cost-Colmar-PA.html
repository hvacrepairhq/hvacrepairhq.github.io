<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
