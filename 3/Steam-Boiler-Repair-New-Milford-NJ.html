<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives normally total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary price of a system competitive with standard devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout new building and construction (houses generally use in between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heat systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because forced air heating unit flow airborne contaminants throughout the house throughout operation, provoking a variety of various unfavorable effects. Radiant heat systems do not distribute air at all, which in fact enhances your indoor air quality by limiting your direct exposure to high levels of airborne pollutants.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
