<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request.

Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
