<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.

The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be installed on walls or set up within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
