If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

<p>Great Product! Delivery was kind of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved concerns. I would recommend this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
