They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair price.
