<h3>Ductless AC System in Milpitas CA</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
