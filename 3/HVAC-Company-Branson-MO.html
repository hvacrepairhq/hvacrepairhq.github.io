<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is designed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure products, smoking cigarettes, home items, and using unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in manufactured products.

<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.
