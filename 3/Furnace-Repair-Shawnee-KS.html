Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

The air conditioner could cycle constantly or act unpredictably if the sensing unit is knocked out of position. The sensor ought to be near the coil however not touching it; adjust its position by carefully flexing the wire that holds it in place.<p>
