<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the very same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, given that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
