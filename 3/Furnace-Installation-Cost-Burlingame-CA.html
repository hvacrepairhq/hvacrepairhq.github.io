<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your a/c is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a service. A trained technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and efficiency of your air conditioner is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>. Before picking the installation area of a/c, several main factors require to be considered. First of all, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems need to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there need to not be any barriers on the way of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor system must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outdoors and the productivity of the entire system will drop dramatically. It is extremely a good idea to install the air conditioning system systems in quickly available locations, for further maintenance throughout operation.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
