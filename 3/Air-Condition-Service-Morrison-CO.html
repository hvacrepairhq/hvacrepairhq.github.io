<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the system has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
