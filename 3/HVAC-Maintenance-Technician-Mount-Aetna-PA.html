<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Mount Aetna PA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses.

Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem.
