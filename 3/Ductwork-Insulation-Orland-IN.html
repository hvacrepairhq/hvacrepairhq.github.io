<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

If it blows once again, call a pro-- you have actually got more serious concerns.<p>
