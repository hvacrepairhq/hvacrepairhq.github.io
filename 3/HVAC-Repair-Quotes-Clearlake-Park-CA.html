<p>Normally the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Think about possible results of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system. Follow the manufacturer's directions, particularly instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
