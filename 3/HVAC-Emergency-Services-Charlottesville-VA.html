<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

The typical summer season temperature level to reach the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the correct SEER rating for your area, deduct 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83.

<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from processes or products; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
