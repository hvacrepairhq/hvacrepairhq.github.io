<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.
