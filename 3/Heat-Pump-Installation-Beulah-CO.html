<p>There are two main forms of glowing flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to withstand current, which then generates heat.<p>
