Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
