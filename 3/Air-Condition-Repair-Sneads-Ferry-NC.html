<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Production integrates quality items and impressive service with development and technological advances to deliver high-performance heating & cooling items worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit.

<p>Air conditioning unit producers normally make rugged, high quality products. Start by examining any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>

This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
