<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
