<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
