<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
