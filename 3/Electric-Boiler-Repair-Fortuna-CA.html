<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Fortuna CA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home building is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floors, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>

<p>The exhaust outlets permit all dangerous gases to escape your residential or commercial property so there's no risky accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. They can lead to a dangerous build-up and jeopardize your security if the exhaust outlets are obstructed. The technician will assess all of these aspects of your system and examine the chimney flue and vent stack too. They will try to find indications of corrosion, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the tools or abilities required to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician check the system occasionally.<p>
