<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's probably your issue.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
