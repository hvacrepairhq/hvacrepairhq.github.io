<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Whitethorn CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by certified HVAC professionals. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
