<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from products or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
