Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
