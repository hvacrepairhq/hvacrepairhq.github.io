<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
