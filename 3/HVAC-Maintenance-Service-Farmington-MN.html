I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
