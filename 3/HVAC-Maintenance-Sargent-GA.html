<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Sargent GA</h3>
<p>Created to improve manufacturing process control in a printing plant, Carrier's development managed not just temperature however also humidity Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of items with steam and reversed the process. Rather of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the space manageable. The regulated temperature and humidity helped keep consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's innovation was applied to increase efficiency in the office, and The Carrier Cooling Company of America was formed to satisfy rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in houses and vehicles as well.<p>
