<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
