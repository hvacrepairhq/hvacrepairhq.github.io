<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature level.

If your house is not heating up, just be concerned. However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must contact a professional to repair the unit and inspect.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of illness caused by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
