<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In lots of split-system air conditioners, this indoor cabinet also contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump.

A split-system is the most affordable central air conditioner to set up if your house currently has a furnace however no air conditioner.<p>
<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Alamo California</h3>
<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is frosty. Likewise, if the air conditioning unit smells bad, there might be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your home. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>The heat pump gained appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can draw out heat from numerous sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air inside. At first, heatpump HVAC systems were just used in moderate climates, however with enhancements in low temperature level operation and minimized loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
