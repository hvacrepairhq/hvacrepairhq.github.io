<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
