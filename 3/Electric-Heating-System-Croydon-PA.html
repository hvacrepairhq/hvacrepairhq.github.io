<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no pollutant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stagnant air may also be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to represent a boost in the number of employees in the area.<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heating systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because required air heater flow airborne contaminants throughout the house throughout operation, provoking a variety of different unfavorable impacts. Radiant heat systems don't distribute air at all, which really improves your indoor air quality by limiting your exposure to high levels of airborne pollutants.<p>

Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these diseases do disappoint up until several years after direct exposure began.

Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
