<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
