The typical summertime temperature to get to the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to come to the right SEER score for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83.

<p>A third method to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your house might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty.

Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
