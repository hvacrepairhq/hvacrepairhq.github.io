Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
