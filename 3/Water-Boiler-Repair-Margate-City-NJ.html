<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
