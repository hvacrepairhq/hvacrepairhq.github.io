Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater.
