<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The EPA recommends that you have your air ducts inspected by an expert heating and cooling contractor. If your technician discovers that your air ducts have considerable mold, dust, dirt, and other contaminants or a moldy smell, they might recommend duct cleaning This is specifically important if someone in your household has asthma, allergies, or other signs that might be related to indoor air contamination.<p>
