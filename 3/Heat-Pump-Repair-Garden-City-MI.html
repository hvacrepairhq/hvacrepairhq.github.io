<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at Garden City MI</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>

We have actually partnered with some of the most reputable heating and cooling and producers in the market, and as an American Standard Convenience Care and Mitsubishi Electric Diamond dealership since 1998, you get longer and better guarantees when purchasing through WSB HVAC.<p>
