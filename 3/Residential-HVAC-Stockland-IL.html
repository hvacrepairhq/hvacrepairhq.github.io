The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for years, until the mandate for high-efficiency systems required Goettl to end production.

<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
