<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
