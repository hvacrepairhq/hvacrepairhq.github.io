<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
