<p>Its unique function is the presence of one main external unit that connected to numerous indoor systems. Such systems may be the best option for keeping the microclimate in numerous offices, stores, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not intensify the visual look of the building. The main external system can be connected to numerous various indoor types: flooring, ceiling, cassette, etc<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
