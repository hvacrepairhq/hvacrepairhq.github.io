<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>For example, problems occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in adequate amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation likewise takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or put in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Improperly located outdoor air intake vents can likewise bring in air infected with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
