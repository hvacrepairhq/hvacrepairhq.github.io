<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate appropriate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or put in such a method that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Improperly located outside air consumption vents can likewise bring in air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
