<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated performance advantage. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions because they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
