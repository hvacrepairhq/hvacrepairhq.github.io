<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>These two types of glowing flooring heat are basic in concept. However, both systems have a huge array of different elements for different applications as well as a range of brand and particular installation requirements. Among the biggest factors to consider in choosing a particular type of glowing flooring heat is whether the application is in brand-new construction or if it's being installed in a renovation.<p>
