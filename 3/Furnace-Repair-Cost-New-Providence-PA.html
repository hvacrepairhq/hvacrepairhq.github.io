<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in New Providence PA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
