<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal elements also. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple rooms at the same time, but are not very energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may invest more cash on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
