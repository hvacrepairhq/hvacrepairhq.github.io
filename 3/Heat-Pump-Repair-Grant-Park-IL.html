<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>
