<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price great however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very extensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn supplied great customer service at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have actually done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
