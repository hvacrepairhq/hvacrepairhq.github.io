<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Flora MS</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house building is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>

Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
