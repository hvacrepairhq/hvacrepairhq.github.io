Because they don't require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
