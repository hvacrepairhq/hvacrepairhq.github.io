<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up simply a couple of years back.<p>
