<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working, integrity Energy was fast to react. They showed up the next day and changed 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heating systems can heat the house.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
