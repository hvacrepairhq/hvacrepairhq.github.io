<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Raceland LA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We picked getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
