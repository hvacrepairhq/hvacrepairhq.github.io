Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
