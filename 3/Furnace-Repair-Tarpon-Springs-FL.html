<p>Specific immediate impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently challenging to figure out if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is necessary to take note of the time and place the signs happen. If the signs fade or go away when a person is away from the house and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects may be worsened by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the humidity, cooling, or heating conditions prevalent in the house.<p>
