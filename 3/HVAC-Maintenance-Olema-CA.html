<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was sort of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact.

We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets.
