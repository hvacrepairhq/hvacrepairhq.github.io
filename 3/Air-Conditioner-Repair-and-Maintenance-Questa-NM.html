<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat.

The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
