<p>Many people ignore the degree of the indoor air pollution issue. Air contamination is normally envisioned as the black smoke given off from factories. Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides used in the house.

<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists used various methodologies. The CMHC research study called on numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they belonged to a study, and the scientists did not control for time invested or methods utilized.

While the duct-cleaning industry argues both research studies have flaws, no other research study has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and techniques utilized by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered considering that these research studies were carried out, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>
