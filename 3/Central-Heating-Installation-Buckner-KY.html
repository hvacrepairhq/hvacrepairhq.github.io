<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
