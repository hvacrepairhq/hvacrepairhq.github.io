<p>Similar to most home improvement projects, the cost of a full central heater can differ widely based upon the size of the home. A lot of heating systems will last between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners ought to consider heat output and effectiveness.

A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
