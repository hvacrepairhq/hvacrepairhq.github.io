<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Blackstock SC</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>If you are considering setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home, plan on spending numerous thousand dollars for the total system. The size of the system figures out the labor hours included to construct the system.
