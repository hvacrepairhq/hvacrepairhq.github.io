<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Ardmore AL Home Owners</h3>
<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window a/c with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors eliminate impurities directly from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by certified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many people.<p>
