<p>Consider potential impacts of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the maker's instructions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
