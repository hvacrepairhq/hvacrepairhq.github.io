<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and buildings develop up indoors.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new home owner I have learned how to determine the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
