<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Tomball TX</h3>
<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
