<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
