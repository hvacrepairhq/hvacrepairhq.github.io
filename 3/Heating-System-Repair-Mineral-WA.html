<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was kind of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which normally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
