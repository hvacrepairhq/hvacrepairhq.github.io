Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor.

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
