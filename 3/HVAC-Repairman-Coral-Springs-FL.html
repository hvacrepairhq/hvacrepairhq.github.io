<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their total power must not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it considers not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

How do I know. I now work as a specialist to validate the so called problems and remedies. 9 out of 10, I inspect are totally incorrect.<p>
