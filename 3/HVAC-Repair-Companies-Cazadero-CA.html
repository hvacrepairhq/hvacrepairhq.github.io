<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works however the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
