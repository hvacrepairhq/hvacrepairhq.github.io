<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
