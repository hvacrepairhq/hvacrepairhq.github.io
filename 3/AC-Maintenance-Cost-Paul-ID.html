<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space.
