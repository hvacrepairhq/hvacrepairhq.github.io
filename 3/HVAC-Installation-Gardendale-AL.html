<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
