<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
