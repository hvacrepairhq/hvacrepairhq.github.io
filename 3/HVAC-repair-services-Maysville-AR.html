I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a distribution system. Metal pipes are rarely utilized due to long-term destructive issues.
