<h3>Ventilation Systems in Satartia MS</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally greater than many heatpump choices, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the design you purchase.
