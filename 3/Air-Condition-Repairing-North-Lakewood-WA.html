An operating air conditioning system is crucial to your health and convenience. We're available at all hours to make sure that your system remains that method.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system.
