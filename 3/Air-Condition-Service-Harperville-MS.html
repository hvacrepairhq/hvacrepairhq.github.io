<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Harperville MS</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants released by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside might cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in a lot of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
