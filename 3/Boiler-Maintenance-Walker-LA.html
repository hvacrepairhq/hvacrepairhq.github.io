<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Walker LA</h3>
<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is usually acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
