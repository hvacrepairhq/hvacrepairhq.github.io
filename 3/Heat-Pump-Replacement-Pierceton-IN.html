<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.

I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
