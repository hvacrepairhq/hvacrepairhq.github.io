<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
