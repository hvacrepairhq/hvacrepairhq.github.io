What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
