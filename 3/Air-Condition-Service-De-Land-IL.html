<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

Sending heat through solid objects will also cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A home heated by a glowing system will heat up much faster, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the many benefits that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>
