<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
