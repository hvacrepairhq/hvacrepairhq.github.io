<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
