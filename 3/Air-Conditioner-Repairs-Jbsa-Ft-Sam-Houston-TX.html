<p>The exhaust outlets permit all hazardous gases to escape your residential or commercial property so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. They can lead to a hazardous build-up and jeopardize your security if the exhaust outlets are obstructed.

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
