<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
