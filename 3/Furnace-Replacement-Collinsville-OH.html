<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the go to. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
