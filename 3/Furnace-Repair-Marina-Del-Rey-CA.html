<p>We take a look at hints before we provide guidance to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
