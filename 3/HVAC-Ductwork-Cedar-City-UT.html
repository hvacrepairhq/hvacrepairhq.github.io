This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Cedar City UT</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
