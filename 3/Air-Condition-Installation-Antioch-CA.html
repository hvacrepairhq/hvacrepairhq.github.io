<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician examine the system periodically.<p>
<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may select to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor system. However, thinking about recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it might be better to replace the whole system.<p>
