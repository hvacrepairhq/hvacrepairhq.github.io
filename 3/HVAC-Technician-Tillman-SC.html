<p>We're investing a lot more time inside, these days. While many individuals assume contamination is simply an outside problem, your home (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't think enough about direct exposure to all the important things we put in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- immediately, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
