<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
