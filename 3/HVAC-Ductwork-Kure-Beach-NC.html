<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
