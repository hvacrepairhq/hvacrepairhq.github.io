<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them..

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to discuss short cycling in extremely cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the really low temperature levels. Often, the furnace will just run more difficult to keep a warm environment for your home when the weather is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our specialists if you require clearness on this concern.<p>
