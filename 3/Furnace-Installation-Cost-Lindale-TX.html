<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
