<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>

<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in New City NY</h3>
