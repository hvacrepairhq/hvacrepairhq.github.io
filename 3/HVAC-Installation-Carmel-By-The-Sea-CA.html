<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
