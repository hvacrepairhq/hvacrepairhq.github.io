<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Area control includes moving the toxin source away from occupants and even transferring prone residents.<p>
<p>People who are allergic to these toxins should utilize allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bed linen in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent room home furnishings that accumulate dust, particularly if they can not be washed in hot water. Allergic people should likewise leave the house while it is being vacuumed because vacuuming can really increase air-borne levels of mite allergens and other biological impurities.
