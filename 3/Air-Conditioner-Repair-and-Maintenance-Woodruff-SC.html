<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Woodruff SC - The Benefits</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
