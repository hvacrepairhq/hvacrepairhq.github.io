<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as just radiant systems.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>
