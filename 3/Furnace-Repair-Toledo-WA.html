<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later on).

The female crimp connectors ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
