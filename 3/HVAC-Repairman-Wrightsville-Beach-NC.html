<p>Use or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of minimizing exposure to indoor air toxins, also will reduce but not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that smoking produces such big quantities of toxins, natural or mechanical ventilation strategies do not remove them from the air in your house as quickly as they develop. In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it takes to substantially reduce direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially. Consequently, the most efficient way to decrease exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to get rid of cigarette smoking there.<p>
