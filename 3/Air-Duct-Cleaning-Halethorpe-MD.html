<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness.

My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for.
