<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Athens AL</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you work with to install your central air conditioning unit. In reality, you can even DIY, despite our strong recommendation not to do so. If you do take our suggestion, anticipate to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to install central air conditioning. In addition, cooling contractors might charge an additional $50 to $200 for additional supplies and devices.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their efficiency over time. Anticipate to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
