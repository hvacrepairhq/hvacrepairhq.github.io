<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
