<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better solution. If the current system has actually not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the 2 should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for producing power in the form of electrical power. The two operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
