<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
