<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
