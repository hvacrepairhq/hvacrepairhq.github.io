Place the a/c back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
