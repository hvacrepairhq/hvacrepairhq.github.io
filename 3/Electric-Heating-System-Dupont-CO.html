<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Dupont</h2>

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, instead of outdoor or industrial settings.

<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Dupont CO</h3>
<p>The majority of people know that outside air pollution can impact their health, however indoor air pollution can also have substantial, hazardous impact. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants indicate that indoor levels of toxins might be 2 to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the top five ecological health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
