<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can afford, many Seattleites must find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a cruel, terrible summertime.<p>

While an area heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
