<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
