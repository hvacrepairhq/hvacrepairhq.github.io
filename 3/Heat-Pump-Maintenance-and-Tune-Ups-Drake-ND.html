<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the technicians believed they just didn't appear best and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you understand it remains in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers moderate results that are typically incorrect for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, disorientation, tiredness and nausea. The effects of CO exposure can differ significantly from individual to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
