<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit airflow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down completely. By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can normally be done in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
