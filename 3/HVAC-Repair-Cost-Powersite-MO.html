<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be residing in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. There are numerous style techniques in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment and large houses.

A steam boiler replacement expenses between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
