<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
