<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.
