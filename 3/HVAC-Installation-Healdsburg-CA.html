<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
