<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
