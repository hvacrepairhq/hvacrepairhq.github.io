Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
