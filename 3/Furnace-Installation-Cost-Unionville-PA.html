<p>I admit I have not done the math recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
