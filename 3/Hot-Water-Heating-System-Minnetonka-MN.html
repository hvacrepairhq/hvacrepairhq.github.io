<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Minnetonka MN Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the various homes they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile houses, apartment or condos, high-rise condos, row housing, etc.). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, adequate air flow (ventilation), appropriate filtration, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is operating securely and not adding to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
