<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Big Lake MN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the concern and fixed extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
