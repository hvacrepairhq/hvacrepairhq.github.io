<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were valuable and helpful, Ballard Gas gave us a much better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heater and located methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these minor however considerable modifications in his quote. We chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of current warmer summers and for environmental factors.<p>
