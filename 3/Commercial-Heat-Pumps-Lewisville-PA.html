<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
