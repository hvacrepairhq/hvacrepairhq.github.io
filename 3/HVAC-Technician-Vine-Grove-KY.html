<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. If your a/c unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Simply adding refrigerant is not a service if it leakages. A trained technician should repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
