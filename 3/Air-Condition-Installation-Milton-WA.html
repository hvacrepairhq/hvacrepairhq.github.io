<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
