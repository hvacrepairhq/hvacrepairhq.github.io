<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
