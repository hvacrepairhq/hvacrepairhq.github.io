<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
