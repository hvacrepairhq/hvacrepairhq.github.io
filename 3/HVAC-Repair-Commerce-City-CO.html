Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
