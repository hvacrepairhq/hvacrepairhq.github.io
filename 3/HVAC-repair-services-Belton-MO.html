<p>Created to improve manufacturing process control in a printing plant, Carrier's invention managed not only temperature however likewise humidity Provider used his understanding of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Rather of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and consequently the amount of moisture in the air could be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The regulated temperature level and humidity helped preserve consistent paper dimensions and ink positioning.
