<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not restricted to homes. In reality, many office complex have significant air contamination sources Some of these buildings might be inadequately aerated. For example, mechanical ventilation systems may not be developed or operated to offer appropriate quantities of outdoor air.
