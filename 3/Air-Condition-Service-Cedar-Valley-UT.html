<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage.

Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the necessary electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
