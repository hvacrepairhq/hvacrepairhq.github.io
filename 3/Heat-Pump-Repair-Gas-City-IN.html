<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually enjoyed the single-family house installation company completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Both should be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>A health questionnaire need to be established and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool must recognize the variety of individuals affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; identify where they are located within the office; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of particular health symptoms or illnesses; determine all devices operated in the work environment; indicate the kind of outside air pollution; and determine prospective sources of task stress.<p>
<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on private sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
