<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
