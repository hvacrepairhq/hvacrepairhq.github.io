<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard.

Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t correctly identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
