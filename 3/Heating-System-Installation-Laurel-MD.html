<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
