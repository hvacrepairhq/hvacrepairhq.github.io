Pushed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds).
