Localized radiant floor heat systems to be utilized in one or several rooms like bathrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are quickly renovated with electric glowing flooring heat. This is much more economical on a smaller sized scale. Bigger renovations like additions to a home might be suitable for a bigger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
