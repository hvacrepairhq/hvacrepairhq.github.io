<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might notice moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, speak to your medical professional about them. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
