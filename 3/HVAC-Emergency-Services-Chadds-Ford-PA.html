<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly harden and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
