<p>There are numerous reasons this can occur. Fortunately is that you can resolve a lot of these factors on your own without the need to call for professional aid. Start by opening the heat registers and after that move on to checking the thermostat settings. Next, check the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover. You can also check the filter to make sure it is clear of dirt and examine the standing pilot burner to ensure it is lit.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
