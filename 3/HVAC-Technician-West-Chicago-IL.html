<h3>Some Useful Strategies To Follow If You Want To Update Your Own Central Heating Boiler in West Chicago IL</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in house construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofings. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air assists and waters down indoor impurities tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
