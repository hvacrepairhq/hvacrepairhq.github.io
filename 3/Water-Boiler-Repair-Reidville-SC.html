The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
