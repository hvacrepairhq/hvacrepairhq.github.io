<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
