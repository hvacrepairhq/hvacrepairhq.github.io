<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, rather than commercial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
