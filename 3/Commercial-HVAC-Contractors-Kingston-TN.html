<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Kingston TN Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various house efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to assist us discuss which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was impressive. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the necessary electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
