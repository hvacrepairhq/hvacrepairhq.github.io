He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
