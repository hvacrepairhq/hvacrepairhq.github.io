<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
