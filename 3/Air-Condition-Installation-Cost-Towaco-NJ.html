<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the rate excellent however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
