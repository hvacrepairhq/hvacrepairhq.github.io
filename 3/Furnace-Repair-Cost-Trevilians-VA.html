<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized.

<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.

<p>These people have been fantastic. At a realtor, I in some cases require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what deal with a house may cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these people two times. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the sincerity. Stability isn't just their name, it's a company model they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They satisfied my needs completely by offering an expert quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one reaction specified the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.. an extremely useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
