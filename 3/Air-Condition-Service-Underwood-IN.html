Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.

Such details can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer.

Review of this information may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
