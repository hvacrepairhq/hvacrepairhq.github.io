<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
