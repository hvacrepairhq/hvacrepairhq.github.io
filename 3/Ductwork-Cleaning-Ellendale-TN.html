<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
