Stagnant air may also be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the variety of workers in the location.<p>

You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing.

<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>

Anticipate to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
