<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
