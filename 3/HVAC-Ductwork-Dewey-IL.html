<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives normally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial cost of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new building (houses normally use between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
