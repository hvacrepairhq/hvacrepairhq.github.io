<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear.

During high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<h3>Home Furnace in Midland GA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
