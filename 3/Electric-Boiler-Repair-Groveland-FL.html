<p>Although installation is easy and does not need much time, trying this task is not a good concept. Unless you have training and knowledge of HVAC systems, handling the installation could cause damage or installation errors that cause higher utility bills and bad system efficiency. Furthermore, HVAC systems have service warranties that require qualified professionals to perform installation. You might void the warranties by taking on that task.<p>
<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
