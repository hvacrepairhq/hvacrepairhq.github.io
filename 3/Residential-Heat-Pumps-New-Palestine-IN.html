Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
