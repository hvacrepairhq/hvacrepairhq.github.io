<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends on private sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to person.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.
