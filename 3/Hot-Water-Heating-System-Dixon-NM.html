<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they need to be placed. Many frequently they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people mainly remain seated in that specific location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensing unit accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
