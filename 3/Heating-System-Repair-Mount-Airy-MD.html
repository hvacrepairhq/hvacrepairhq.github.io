<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>

A basic ac system transfers heat out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
