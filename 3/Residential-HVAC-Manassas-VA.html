According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in.
