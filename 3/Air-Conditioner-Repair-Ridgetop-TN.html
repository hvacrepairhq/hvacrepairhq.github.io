I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Am delighted I got this however due to the fact that it has restored my faith in great production. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Provider I got considering that I bought it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
