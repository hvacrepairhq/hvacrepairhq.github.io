<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
