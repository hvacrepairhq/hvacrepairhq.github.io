<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Most people do not understand how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier. All the damp hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC unit is not draining pipes properly. A restriction in your drain pipes triggers a water leak. There are many different places a clog can happen. One of the primary areas where obstructions begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
