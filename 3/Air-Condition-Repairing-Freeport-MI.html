<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
