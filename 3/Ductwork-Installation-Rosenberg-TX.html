<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Rosenberg TX Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it increasingly difficult for your lungs to operate appropriately, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
