<h3>Electric Heating System in Beaverton OR</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
