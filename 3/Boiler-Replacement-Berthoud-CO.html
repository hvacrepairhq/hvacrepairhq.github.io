For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may notice unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy.

Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
