<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your home.

<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Bergenfield NJ</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
