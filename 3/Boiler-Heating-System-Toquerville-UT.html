<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
