<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Mineola IA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your house in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfy as you can be? Do you discover it to be either too cold throughout the winter season or too warm in areas throughout the summer? Whether you're having an issue with uneven cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific House & Comfort, Inc. has the services and items you need.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
