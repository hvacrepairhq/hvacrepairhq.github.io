<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Valley Cottage NY</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in home building is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofs.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air assists and waters down indoor impurities tire them from the house.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
