<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is generally used in a 2nd or third-floor  location and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put.
