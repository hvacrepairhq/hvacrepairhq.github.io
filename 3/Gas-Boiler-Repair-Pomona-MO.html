<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, given that it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
