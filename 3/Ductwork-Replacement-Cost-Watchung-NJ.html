<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
