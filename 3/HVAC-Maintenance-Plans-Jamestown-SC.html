<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
