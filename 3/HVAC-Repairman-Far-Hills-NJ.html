<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
