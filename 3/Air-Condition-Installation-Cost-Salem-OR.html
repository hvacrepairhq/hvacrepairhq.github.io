<p>I have actually used all the time for 5 plus years now. I have actually signed a yearly maintenance agreement which covers two services every year.

Whenever he sees any issues, he informs me about it and proactively repairs the parts. Very delighted with their service. Would suggest them anytime.<p>
<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Salem Oregon</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Switch off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work properly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work completely unless you do this.<p>
