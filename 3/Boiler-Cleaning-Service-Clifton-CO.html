During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

There have been awkward noises. I got it repaired and inspected. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. Overall, it has been a good experience. Reputable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. But then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Because an a/c moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
