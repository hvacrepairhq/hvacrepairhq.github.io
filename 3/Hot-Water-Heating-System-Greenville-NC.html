<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Greenville NC</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any airflow constraint will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the abilities or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
