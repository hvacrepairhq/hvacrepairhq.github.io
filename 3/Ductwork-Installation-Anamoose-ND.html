<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance check outs each year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and usually some other benefits. Some companies use priority appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>
