<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>The EPA recommends that you have your duct inspected by a professional heating and cooling contractor.
