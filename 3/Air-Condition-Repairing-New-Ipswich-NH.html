<p>Certain instant results are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically challenging to figure out if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is important to pay attention to the time and location the symptoms take place. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort ought to be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>Some health effects might show up soon after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are treatable and typically short-term. Often the treatment is merely removing the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Not long after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some illness such as asthma might appear, be worsened or intensified.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "routine" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to figure out if the general indoor air quality fulfills a particular requirement.

These limitations may not be appropriate in office settings or for the house.<p>
