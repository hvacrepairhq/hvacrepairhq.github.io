<p>It is also advised for locals of Redmond to have access to heating systems inside their homes. During the winter seasons, heating systems provide sufficient heating power to homes in the neighborhood. The typical daytime temperature highs throughout December, January, and February range from the mid-40s to low-50s.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
