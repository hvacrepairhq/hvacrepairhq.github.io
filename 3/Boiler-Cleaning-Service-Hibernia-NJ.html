<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in large commercial structures can not be effectively recognized or treated without an extensive structure investigation. These examinations may begin with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which structure investigators assess the history of resident signs and building operation treatments. In some cases, these questions might rapidly reveal the problem and on-site sees are unnecessary.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may end up being blocked, reducing air flow circulation, quality, and volume. They also might become locations for molds and germs to be and grow distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be appropriately kept to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
