<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new building and construction (homes usually use between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my services, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is truthful, trusted, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
