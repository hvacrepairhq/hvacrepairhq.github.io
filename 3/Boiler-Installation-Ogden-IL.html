<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from usage.

Heaters that kick on frequently might be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
