<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective.
