<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
