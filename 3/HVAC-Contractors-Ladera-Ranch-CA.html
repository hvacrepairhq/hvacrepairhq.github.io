<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
