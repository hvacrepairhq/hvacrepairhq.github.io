<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them up until they have been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
