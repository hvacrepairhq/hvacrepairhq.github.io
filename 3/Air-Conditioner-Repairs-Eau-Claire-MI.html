<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
