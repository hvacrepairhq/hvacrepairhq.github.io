Lower concentrations can trigger a series of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weak point, disorientation, queasiness, and confusion, to fatigue in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest pain in individuals with chronic heart disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are sometimes puzzled with the flu or gastrointestinal disorder.
