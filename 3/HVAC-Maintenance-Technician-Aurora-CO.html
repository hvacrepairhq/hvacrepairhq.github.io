<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
