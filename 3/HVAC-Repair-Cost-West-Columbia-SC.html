<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in West Columbia South Carolina</h3>
<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
