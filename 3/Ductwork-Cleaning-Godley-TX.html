<p>Information offered in this security guide is based upon current clinical and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Structures constantly progress as a result of the modifications in the environment around them along with the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The numerous surface areas and the air inside a structure are constantly communicating, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we may see a window as altering slightly over time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be progressing as a result of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>

When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right now, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).
