<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
