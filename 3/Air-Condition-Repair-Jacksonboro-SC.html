<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
