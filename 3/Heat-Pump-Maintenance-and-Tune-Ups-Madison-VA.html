Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes.

If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
