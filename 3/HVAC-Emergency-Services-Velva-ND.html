<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
