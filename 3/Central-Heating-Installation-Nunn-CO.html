<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While space cooling provides maximum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in collecting details on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
