<p>The possibility of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>
