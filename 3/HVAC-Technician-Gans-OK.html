The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
