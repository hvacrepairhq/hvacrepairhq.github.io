<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
