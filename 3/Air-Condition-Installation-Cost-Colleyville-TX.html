<p>The majority of well and city water does not usually consist of lead. Water usually gets lead inside the home from home plumbing that is made with lead materials. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked, the only way to know. Contact the local health department or the water provider to discover how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, a lot of Seattleites must discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a terrible, vicious summer season.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimum performance and might overheat.

It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not huge enough for your house. If the system is too little, it will have to work harder and might overheat. Usually, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
