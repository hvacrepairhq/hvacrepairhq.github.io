<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps must also be required to minimize contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners ought to be alert to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization steps need to not be carried out till these problems have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
<p>Stability Energy fasted to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They showed up the next day and changed 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new furnaces can heat the house. Truthfully, our house heater is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>Occupants of houses with poor indoor air quality may complain of symptoms such as headache, eye inflammation, fatigue, dry throat, sinus queasiness, dizziness, and blockage.
