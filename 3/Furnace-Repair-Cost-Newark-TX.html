<h3>Facts All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Newark TX</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely effective, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. A lot of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
